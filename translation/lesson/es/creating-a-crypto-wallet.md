## What is a Crypto Wallet?

Crypto wallets are an essential piece of web3 equipment, allowing you to use cryptocurrency on your computer or phone. They often come as a web browser extension for your computer, or an app for your phone.

Yet wallets can do more than hold cryptocurrency. They’re our connection with a blockchain. Wallets are used to exchange cryptocurrency with others, log into blockchain applications, **and even collect digital items like Bankless Academy badges.** The more we explore, the more our wallets become — with some calling them your digital identity.

Wallets come with two core pieces of account information:

- A `public key`, that you can think of as your _username_. You’ll share it publicly to receive cryptocurrency.

- A `private key`, acting as your _password_. This should always be kept private, and cannot be changed.

Protecting your private key is critical because this key grants instant access to your wallet. You should never share your private key. You can learn more by taking [the full lesson](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics).

Today we will set up our first wallet, using our recommended crypto wallet: Zerion!

## FAQ

### What is a cryptocurrency?

Cryptocurrencies are a form of digital money, secured by `cryptography`. These currencies can run without the need for centralized authorities and banks, reducing possibility for fraud while increasing the financial freedom of the holder.

Learn more about cryptocurrency through our **[Bitcoin Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/bitcoin-basics)** lesson, and see how these digital currencies are revolutionizing the financial world!

### What are public and private keys?

Public/private key `encryption` allows your wallet to make some information public, like the address where others can send cryptocurrency to you, while keeping access to your cryptocurrency private. One key is like your cryptocurrency’s house address, and the other unlocks the front door.

You can share your public key with anyone you trust to send you cryptocurrency, but your private key is for your eyes only — because it grants access to all assets inside the wallet. Never share it, even if your contact claims to be from Bankless Academy or Zerion.

Learn more and get rewarded for creating your first wallet, in our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson.

### What happens if I lose my recovery phrase?

Your recovery phrase is your only backup if you lose access to your wallet on your device. If you lose your recovery phrase, your wallet’s holdings will be lost forever. This is why it’s important to store it somewhere safe — from not only theft or loss, but fire or water damage too.

### Can Ethereum wallets hold Bitcoin?

Ethereum wallets can hold Bitcoin, but in a “wrapped” form. If you want to hold original Bitcoin, you’ll have to create a wallet that runs on the Bitcoin network, like [Exodus](https://www.exodus.com/) or [Mycelium](https://wallet.mycelium.com/).
