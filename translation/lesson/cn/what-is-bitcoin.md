# Welcome to Bankless Academy

Welcome, bold Explorer, to the frontier of innovation and personal sovereignty.

At Bankless Academy, our mission is to provide Explorers such as yourself with the essential tools and knowledge to explore the digital frontier. Rather than focusing on commonly used apps and websites, we will be using `cryptocurrency` and `blockchain` technology to build ownership over your online footprint.

Gone are the days of somebody else controlling your online money and data! Today, tools exist that allow us to privately own these assets ourselves.

To start, we will be looking at the most celebrated event in blockchain history: the invention of Bitcoin. Bitcoin set the stage for the greater cryptocurrency movement by creating digital money that doesn’t rely on banks.

# Bitcoin’s Story

Launched in 2009 by the mysterious “`Satoshi Nakamoto`”, bitcoin marked the beginning of a new era in digital currency.

As the first `cryptocurrency`, Bitcoin began a transfer of control over money from the powerful few within conventional banking systems, into the hands of the citizens who earn and use it everyday. If you’re unsure of what exactly this means, you’re in the right place!

The reality is that money is at the center of the modern lifestyle, and every property of that money influences how it is earned, exchanged, saved, or spent. The reality is also that, today, we don’t really own our money.

It’s time to unravel the fascinating story of Bitcoin, and learn how the cryptocurrency movement is solving the modern, unseen dilemma behind one of humanity’s oldest tools.

**It’s time to change how we see money.**

# A Brief History of Money

Money has been an integral part of society since our earliest days, where beads, shells and stones were used to exchange goods & services.

Yet early currencies had a problem: it was too easy for someone to find/create new money. The more of something there is, the less value it has, and so everyone’s money slowly became worth less. If currency was to hold its value, it needed to be harder to find.

Materials like gold & silver were eventually adopted to solve this problem. Their `scarcity` meant that it would be difficult for anyone to add more money to the existing supply.

As societies grew, a government’s central bank would issue standardized coins made of gold & silver. Such currency made money recognizable, measurable, while serving as a strong store of value.

# A Brief History of Money (Pt. 2)

With the arrival of the 20th century came the fall of the “`Gold Standard`”. Precious metals were slowly disconnected from currencies across the world — an effort that would allow any country’s economy to grow beyond its supply of gold. As a central bank no longer needs gold to create currency, they can create as much new money as they deem necessary for their country’s economy.

Electronic currency has also largely replaced physical currency — with most money now stored in commercial banks. While convenient and secure, it has also put a for-profit business between people and their money.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/a-brief-history-of-money-pt-2-1c7f4b4f.svg)

# The Problem

The money we are left with today is no longer truly owned by the people. It is largely under the control of the bank, with its value determined by the central bank. This opens a whole host of problems we will explore throughout this lesson.

With this type of money, you cannot make free financial choices in your life, nor enjoy reliable financial security. You are always subject to being denied access to your money, while the central bank’s printing policy slowly erodes your savings.

***

For money to once again be neutral and reliable, it must regain the two key properties it has lost:

💎 **Value:** It must reliably store value over time, so that you aren’t forced to spend it.

✊ **Ownership:** It must give you sole, unrestricted control over your funds, so they can’t be confiscated without due legal process.

Only these qualities can return financial freedom & security to modern money.

# Enter Bitcoin

`Satoshi Nakamoto` believed that exchange of value shouldn’t be controlled by small groups. He sought to build money with `neutrality` and reliability built into the system. And he did.

Enter Bitcoin, the digital currency powering global transactions completely outside of the traditional banking system.

- ⛓️ Using `blockchain` technology, it connects people directly, rather than going through institutions. It’s fully automated, neutral, and highly resistant to fraud and manipulation.
- 💎 With no central authority to print money, bitcoin has `scarcity` and value-retention similar to gold.
- ✊ With no institution facilitating transfer or storage, the currency returns control to the holder. It’s `self-custodial`: holders store their own funds in a secure online safe.

For these reasons, bitcoin has earned the nickname “digital gold”.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/enter-bitcoin-efba6ccd.svg)

# Digital Gold: Scarcity

Gold is naturally difficult to extract from the earth. In a similar way, undiscovered bitcoin can only be introduced through a difficult process called digital `mining`. There is also a set maximum of 21 million bitcoin ever available to be discovered, mirroring gold’s finite availability in the earth.

This `scarcity` makes both very effective at retaining value, as new supply is difficult to introduce.

***

In traditional currencies, a central bank will introduce between 3% - 15% new currency every year. This supply increase leads to `inflation`, the devaluation of existing money. Inflation is why everything seems to be getting more expensive lately. Goods and services aren’t necessarily worth more, money is just worth less because there’s more of it. As prices rise, most salaries remain the same, creating a higher cost of living for the average person.

To add insult to injury, new supply is typically distributed to the banks, further increasing the wealth divide between the lower, middle and upper classes.

# Knowledge Check 1

What quality allows Bitcoin to preserve its value?

- [ ] Its high transaction speed.

  > Incorrect. While speed is a feature, it's not the key factor in preserving value.

- [ ] Its global reach and acceptance.

  > Incorrect. Global reach enhances its usability but doesn't primarily retain its value.

- [ ] Its finite limit of 21 million coins.

  > Correct! Bitcoin's capped supply creates scarcity, similar to precious metals, aiding value retention.

- [ ] Its ability to facilitate online transactions.

  > Incorrect. Online transaction capability is a convenience feature, not directly linked to value retention.

# Digital Gold: Self-Custody

If your financial institution can freeze your funds at any time — do you truly own your money?

`Self-custody` is Bitcoin’s second key parallel with gold; It can’t be frozen or easily confiscated. As we move into an age where assets are increasingly digitized, it’s important that everyone has tangible ownership over their digital possessions. Besides issues of censorship or fraud, instant control over an entire nation’s property is simply too much power to put in one place.

You can view Bitcoin as having your own vault of gold in a secure online space, where there is no management and only you hold the key.

The system gives you full control over your wealth from anywhere in the world, at any time.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/digital-gold-self-custody-fa1a2c38.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

Which of the following enables true digital ownership?

- [ ] Resistance to inflation.

> Inflation is an increase in supply, and does not affect ownership.

- [ ] Using any kind of online account.

> Almost all internet accounts are stored on third party servers, meaning your provider has access to your assets and data.

- [ ] Full control over your assets without reliance on other parties.

> Correct! When others have control over our assets, there is always a possibility for it to be abused.

# It’s like Emailing Money!

Just as email simplified sending letters by removing the need for post offices, `cryptocurrency` streamlines the transfer of money.

`Blockchains` allow you to transfer digital assets like Bitcoin to anyone else’s safe almost instantly, from anywhere in the world. Like email, Bitcoin is online 24/7; You can send money or trade assets at any hour. No waiting, no paperwork, no downtime.

Like email, the system is fully automated — but unlike email, blockchains can be owned by the community.

In the same way that you have an email address, a single Bitcoin address is used to receive Bitcoin. You’ll manage your account through a new tool called a `cryptocurrency wallet`, directly in your web browser or on your phone. We’ll set up your first wallet in ‘Wallet Basics’ — one of your next lessons!

A cryptocurrency wallet is the easiest “bank account” you’ll ever set up, all from the comfort of your home.

# Knowledge Check 3

How is Bitcoin similar to email?

- [ ] Both are fast, globally accessible, and always online.

> Correct!

- [ ] Both use physical addresses.

> Neither Bitcoin nor email require a physical address. Instead, they use digital addresses.

- [ ] Both operate only during regular business hours.

> Bitcoin, like email, operates 24/7.

# How does it work?

Let’s switch gears and look at the engine powering Bitcoin.

Bitcoin runs on a shared network, hosted across thousands of computers worldwide. Each computer on the network does its small part in keeping the network running; The network is the computers! If one produces an error, the others are there to take its place.

This also means there’s no single point to apply pressure in attempted hacks; In order for the network to be attacked, a majority of the computers would need to be compromised by one group of people.

This defense strategy is called `decentralization`: the shifting of control from one main group to many smaller ones. Decentralization is what makes cryptocurrency transfers virtually unstoppable.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/how-does-it-work-cf820a7a.svg)

# How does it work? (Pt. 2)

When sending cryptocurrency across this network, your transaction is checked and validated by these `decentralized` network participants. These participants, known as `miners`, are constantly organizing transactions and adding them to a database hosted across the network.

This process is known as `mining`. It’s what keeps the network running securely. Mining can get quite complicated, so we’ll take a simplified view:

1. You submit a transaction to the network, sending 0.1 `BTC` to your friend.
2. A miner is randomly selected to check your transaction for errors.
3. Other miners double-check the results to ensure accuracy.
4. If approved, your transaction is added to the database.
5. Your friend receives 0.1 BTC in their `cryptocurrency wallet`.

# The Innovation of Money

In this lesson we’ve looked at how Bitcoin is using decentralized technology to return ownership and lasting value to money. We saw how third-party custodians can only give the illusion of ownership over funds, and learned how the increase of supply in monetary systems erodes long term savings of citizens.

But Bitcoin is more than a tool. It’s invention sparked an entire community of `Decentralized Finance` advocates and builders, focused on:

- innovating on our economic systems
- breaking up the institutional control of money and distributing it to the people
- increasing security and transparency in an effort to reduce monetary fraud, manipulation, and censorship.
- baking equality of opportunity into our monetary systems to close the wealth gap
- building true ownership for the digital age
- helping to reduce tx costs & time, and provide financial tools to unbanked populations.

The DeFi community believes that, just as the separation of church and state empowered the free transfer of ideas, separation of money and state is necessary for the free ownership and transfer of value. In backing this fundamental freedom, DeFi is restoring alignment of money with the values of `democracy`.

_"Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.”_

# Sending a Bitcoin Transaction

It’s time to make your first Bitcoin transaction, and practice your freedom in the digital age.

Your transaction will include the following details:

📫 The wallet address of your recipient.

💰 The amount of Bitcoin to send.

⛏️ A small transaction fee given to the miners.

In our simulator, your transaction will be broadcasted to the Bitcoin network. A miner will process your transaction, other miners will confirm its validity, and it will be added to the blockchain.

Remember to make sure all details are accurate. Once a `block` is confirmed it cannot be reversed.
