# 钱包简介

**Bankless 探险家们，你们好**

是时候深入探索区块链的多元宇宙了。 本空间里的探索者们最终都将学会如何创建一个新的加密钱包。

钱包有点类似于您之前熟悉的`Web2`的互联网账户。 使用加密钱包登录的区块链生态系统，也被称为`web3`，在这里您可以用`加密货币`链接至`区块链应用程序`！

在这一课中，我们将向你介绍加密钱包及其工作原理，如何保护你的加密货币的安全。 最后，我们将向您介绍如何设置和访问**以太坊区块链 —— Bankless 学院的家园**。

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-intro-b6d4487a.png)

# 钱包的定义

加密钱包究竟是什么？

简短的定义是：`区块链`上的账户，用于存储数字资产和登录区块链应用程序。

这就像你在互联网上拥有了自己的私人保险箱，而你掌握着打开保险箱的唯一钥匙。 与此同时，这个保险箱和普通网站的账户很相似。 您可以用它来购物、发送或接收`加密货币`，并与区块链进行交互。

不过，与您习惯的`Web2`需要注册大量账户的情况不同，单个加密钱包就能访问整个区块链、绝大多数区块链应用程序。 这就像仅需一个账户就能畅行整个互联网一样。

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-definition-d2912914.svg)

# 创建加密钱包很困难吗？

这在过去很困难，但现在任何人都可以轻松地创建新的加密钱包。

如果你对在电脑上下载和安装软件（或在手机上安装 APP）很在行，那么创建第一个加密钱包对你来说就是小菜一碟。

管理钱包最棘手的部分在于如何确保加密钱包的安全，我们将在下文中详细介绍！

你的`钱包app`该具体用哪个呢？你一开始可能会感觉无从下手。 这是你即将在设备上安装的 app，用于访问您在区块链上的钱包。 我们建议从 Zerion 钱包 app 开始：它是用户友好型的 app，可以访问绝大多数主流区块链。 随着您在`web3`空间的交互越来越得心应手，您可能会探索其他加密钱包 app，并创建多个钱包。

# Knowledge Check 1

什么是加密钱包？

- [ ] 一条区块链

> ℹ️ 再试一次！ 您的加密钱包确实托管在区块链上，但钱包并不代表一条区块链。

- [ ] 一种加密货币

> ℹ️ 再试一次！ 加密货币只是你放在钱包里的资产之一。

- [ ] 一种数字收藏品

> ℹ️ 再试一次！ 加密货币只是你放在钱包里的资产之一。

- [ ] 一个区块链帐户

> ℹ️ 正确！ 加密钱包是用于与区块链交互的账户。

# 钱包 & 密码重置

这是你必须了解的`web3`钱包最重要事项： **没有 "密码重置 "或 "修改密码"的功能。**

我们大多数人已经习惯了这些功能。 如果我们忘记了密码，只需点击忘记密码的按钮，点几下鼠标就能得到一个新密码。 轻而易举。

但在加密货币钱包的领域这完全不同。 由于区块链的工作原理，钱包在创建时会分配一个 "地址 "和一个复杂的 "密码" —— 你无法主动选择这些参数。

这个地址+密码的组合是无法更改的，但如果有需要，你也可以随时另创一个全新的钱包。 接下来，让我们一起进一步学习这些关于地址和密码的细节，以便更放心的使用加密钱包！

# 您的钱包公钥

`公钥`基本上就是你的钱包地址。 通常，这看起来就像一串随机的字母和数字。

例如:_0xe1887fF140BfA9D3b45D0B2077b7471124acD242_

当然，你也可以通过某些`web3`服务来创建更易记的公钥版本，但这是下一堂课学习的内容。

你也可以把公钥想象成家庭住址。 它是公开的，任何人都可以看到，在不泄露你个人信息的同时它也还在告诉其他人“可以将加密资产发送到这里”。

分享你的钱包**公钥**是绝对安全的。

**注：**单个加密钱包 app 可持有多个`公钥`/`私钥`对。

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/your-wallets-public-key-87828c3e.svg)

# 您的钱包私钥

如果说公钥就像住址，那么`私钥`就像前门钥匙。 它是您的资金和资产的 "密码"。

示例： _eceac283e04f121cbd40b69e16ab9dec0220df80bf092_

**分享私钥绝对不安全 —— 你可能会丢失你的钱包以及钱包里的一切资产。**

大多数人建议您甚至不要将其用电子的形式保存。 谁能获得私钥，谁就能获得`钱包`里的任何东西。

这不仅仅是密码。 如果你弄丢了私钥，它是没办法被重置或被重新获取的。

幸运的是，绝大多数`区块链 app `不会在你每次发送资金或在区块链交易签名时要你输入一大串数码。 私钥通常在后台静默运行。

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/your-wallets-private-key-0d84ad39.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

您的公钥就像您的 _____ ，您的私钥就像您的 _____。

- [ ] 路由号码/账户号码

> ℹ️ 再试一次！ 与银行账号不同，您的私钥不应与他人共享。

- [ ] 地址/邮政编码

> ℹ️ 再试一次！ 与银行账号不同，您的私钥不应与他人共享。

- [ ] 房屋住址/房屋钥匙

> ℹ️ 正确！ 你的公钥可以让别人找到你，而只有私钥才能让你有权访问。

- [ ] 电话号码/护照号码

> ℹ️ 再试一次！ 这些都是公共 & 私人信息的例子，但它们和公私钥并不相关。

# Recovery Phrase

When you set up a new wallet, your wallet app will provide you with a `recovery phrase`.

Also called a “seed phrase” or “secret phrase”, this string of words can be used to access your wallet and crypto assets if:

- Your `wallet app` or device fails unexpectedly or is damaged.
- Your device has been lost or stolen.
- You want to access your wallet on multiple devices.

Most recovery phrases are a list of 12 to 24 words that represent a unique piece of data. This data is used to generate both the `public key` and `private key` for your wallet.

Wallet recovery does **not** change or reset the keys.

Your recovery phrase is essentially an easier to read version of your public/private key pair. **Never share your recovery phrase.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/recovery-phrase-c614c36c.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

Can you access your wallet with a recovery phrase if your device gets damaged or lost?

- [ ] No

> ℹ️ Try again!

- [ ] Yes

> ℹ️ Correct! Recovery phrases grant access to your wallet, even on multiple devices.

# Types of Wallet

Just as there are many types of computer software, there many types of wallet. Let’s look at the four main categories:

- 🏦 **Custodial wallets:** where a third party is responsible for your private keys.
- 👤 **Self-custody (non-custodial) wallets:** where you are responsible for your private keys.

There are two styles of `self-custody wallet`:

- 🔥 **Hot wallets:** software on your desktop or phone.
- 🧊 **Cold wallets:** a piece of hardware (like a memory stick) you store somewhere safe.

Each wallet solution serves a different use-case. Many advanced users have one of each!

Don’t worry, we’ll only be creating one wallet today.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/types-of-wallet-094f0eb1.png)

# Custodial Wallets

Since your `private key` unlocks access to your `wallet`, keeping it safe and secure is very important!

`Custodial wallet` services include cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken. **They are your wallet custodian** — they look after your private keys for you. You access their services like any other website (with an email login and resettable password).

This may be all some people need, but it requires you to trust these third parties to secure your crypto assets and give you access when you want to trade them or send them somewhere. Also, your access to some `blockchain apps` may be limited.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/custodial-wallets-4eede755.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

Do you control your private key with a custodial wallet?

- [ ] Yes

> ℹ️ Try again!

- [ ] No

> ℹ️ Correct! Custodial wallets require trust in a third party (custodian) to control your private keys.

# Non-custodial Wallet

A `self-custody wallet` (like Zerion or Trezor) is when you fully control your `private key`. You have **no custodian**, and you alone are responsible for keeping your private key safe.

These wallets offer the widest range of access and freedom within the world of `web3`. You never have to worry about a third party freezing or mishandling your funds.

The trade-off is in risk: if you lose access to your `recovery phrase`, or your private key is compromised, there is often very little you can do to restore access to the wallet.

Whichever route you choose, it pays to be familiar and comfortable with wallet security. We’ll give you some tips before you complete this lesson.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/non-custodial-wallet-833c3d6b.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

Are you responsible for your private key with a self-custody wallet?

- [ ] Yes

> ℹ️ Correct! With a self-custody wallet you are solely responsible for your private keys.

- [ ] No

> ℹ️ Try again!

# Hot Wallets

You will hear the terms “hot” and “cold wallet” quite a bit in `web3`.

A `hot wallet` is a wallet accessed via an app on your device — the Zerion app for example. Similar to many `web2` apps, a wallet app is consistently connected to the internet.

Your `private key` is encrypted and stored inside the wallet app, and is only accessed when you interact with the blockchain. These wallets are named ‘hot wallets’ for this “hot” connection between the internet and your private key.

Hot wallets are convenient for small day-to-day interactions, much like a physical wallet you keep in your pocket. We’ll be creating a hot wallet today!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/hot-wallets-9356886d.svg)

# Cold Wallets

As you dive deeper into your `web3` journey, you will come to know a landscape full of interesting tech trade-offs.

`Cold wallets` grant higher security at the cost of convenience. A cold wallet is one where your `private key` is stored on a dedicated hardware device (like a memory stick or external hard drive). You must physically connect the hardware wallet to your computer to access your wallet on the blockchain. Your private key is never directly connected to the internet. Cold wallets are named after this “cold” internet connection.

They are widely considered to be more secure than `hot wallets`, because your `private key` is stored offline — out of reach of digital attackers.

Ledger and Trezor are examples of `cold wallets`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/cold-wallets-0e3183d1.svg)

# Knowledge Check 6

Which of the following wallet types is considered the most secure?

- [ ] All wallets are about the same

> ℹ️ Try again! There are various trade-offs for each wallet type, with level of security being one of them.

- [ ] A hot wallet

> ℹ️ Try again! A hot wallet has an active internet connection which makes it more susceptible to digital attack.

- [ ] A custodial wallet

> ℹ️ Try again! The third party holding the private keys can get hacked or go bankrupt.

- [ ] A cold wallet

> ℹ️ Correct! Cold wallets aren’t actively connected to the internet, making them more attack-resistant.

# Wallet Security

Regardless if your `self-custody wallet` is hot or cold, there are many smart security practices you should develop.

🖊️ Record your `recovery phrase` on a physical, durable material (such as laminated paper, or even steel) and store it somewhere very safe. Never share it or your `private key` with anyone. **Remember, this is more than just a password.**

🔍 When interacting with a blockchain or sending funds, even small amounts, double check the details very carefully. Incorrect details cannot be changed after an interaction.

🔭 Spend time researching and gathering info on any `blockchain apps` you plan to interact with before connecting your wallet to it or signing its transactions.

💰 Use wallets with low amounts of funds to try new things and explore web3, and consider storing high value assets across multiple wallet accounts (i.e. avoid putting all your crypto eggs in one basket).

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-security-3a185d90.png)

# Knowledge Check 7

What is the safest way to protect your recovery phrase?

- [ ] Write it on a durable material and store it in a safe place.

> ℹ️ Correct! A safely stored physical backup with no digital traces is the safest storage option.

- [ ] Save it on your computer and print it out.

> ℹ️ Try again! If your computer is hacked, your recovery phrase could be found. Printing also opens many attack opportunities.

- [ ] Take a screenshot and save it on your phone.

> ℹ️ Try again! If your phone is hacked, you could lose all assets in your wallet.

- [ ] Save it in your password manager.

> ℹ️ Try again! If your password manager is hacked, your recovery phrase could be leaked.

# You’re ready to create your first wallet!

In fact, you’ll need one if you want to claim proof of completing this quest!

There are several `self-custody`, `hot wallet` apps available today. We will explore the Zerion wallet for the rest of this lesson as:

- ⚙️ It’s compatible with most `blockchain apps`.
- ⚡ The interface is incredibly smooth and easy to use.
- 💻 It has a browser extension for Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Opera internet browsers.
- 📱 It is also available as a mobile app for Android and iOS users.
- 🗣️ Zerion supports a variety of languages.

The end of the lesson is right around the corner, where we will share your instructions for setting up your wallet with Zerion!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/youre-ready-to-create-your-first-wallet-6d8136f2.svg)

# Knowledge Check 8

Is Zerion a custodial wallet app?

- [ ] Yes

> ℹ️ Try again! Your Zerion wallet isn’t controlled by a custodian.

- [ ] No

> ℹ️ Correct! Zerion wallets are self-custody wallets — controlled by you, and you alone.
