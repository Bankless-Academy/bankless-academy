# 老问题，新工具

现代技术极大地改变了人类的视角和互动方式。 在世界舞台上，在无国界的网络空间中，我们需要新的协调模式，在这个地球村里共存共荣。

`DAO` （去中心化组织）的愿景是简化大量合作者之间的辩论，解决问题 —— 无论是在互联网线上，还是在线下的当地社区，亦或是国际范围内。 具体做法如下：

- 激励参与者共同承担使命。
- 创新的投票、 `授权`和 `否决` 机制。
- 使用区块链技术，减少人为错误，或是减少被技术劫持的可能性。

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/old-problems-new-tools-df0ceb84.svg)

# 网络治理

如同传统拥有资源和广泛参与者的传统民族国家一样，DAO 使用治理流程来指导其资源的部署，实现其使命。 它就像一个市政厅，但却是 `异步`的、全球性的，以代码为部分中介。

📜 **提案：** 首先是治理提议和社区讨论。 提案根据公众的反馈意见进行更新。 任何人都可以提交提案，或对提案进行点评。 这是 "`DAO`"的 "去中心化 "部分。

🗳️ **投票：** 提案进入投票阶段--通过 `链上治理` 的透明、抗审查程序进行。 开票和关票没有任何人工协助，全部由代码进行操作。 这是 "`DAO`"中的 "自治 "部分 —— 这样高质量的设想最终将覆盖整个治理过程。

🛠️ **实施：** 经批准的提案将应用于网络，必要时由各种受激励的开发者们实施。

# Optimism 网络

`DAO` 像最优秀的集体一样，处于探索这种协调系统的前沿。

在本课中，我们将探讨 Optimism 如何开拓 DAO 的愿景。 我们将了解他们的使命，以及他们如何为人类建立新的协调框架。

我们的追求将集中在获得我们的第一个投票权上，这样我们就能为建设以太坊和人类协调的未来做好准备！

# The Optimistic Vision

Optimism is on a mission: to scale Ethereum by building a `Layer 2` network. It’s part of the Ethereum ecosystem, but with lower fees and faster transactions — while maintaining Ethereum’s high standard of security. Here are the defining properties:

🏕️ **Public Goods:** Great emphasis on funding and building onchain `public goods`. A public good is something that benefits everyone in a community, while one person's use of it doesn't reduce its availability for others. Your free education at Bankless Academy has been made possible through Optimism’s support of public goods!

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Community Governance:** The network is lead by its community.

🏠 **Free Market:** Launched as an extension of not just Ethereum `blockspace`, but of Ethereum principles. It aims to scale the permissionless, open-source, censorship-resistant marketplace of Ethereum.

Optimism aims to become a “district of cyberspace” that directly provides for — and is governed by — its citizens!

# Knowledge Check 2

Which of the following is NOT a public good?

- [ ] Education

> ℹ️ Education can benefit everyone, and one person’s use doesn’t reduce its availability.

- [ ] The Internet

> ℹ️ The internet can benefit everyone, and one person’s use doesn’t reduce its availability.

- [ ] Ethereum

> ℹ️ Ethereum can benefit everyone, and — with Layer 2s — one person’s use doesn’t reduce its availability.

- [ ] A Centralized Exchange

> ℹ️ Correct. While CEXs provide community benefits, they are private businesses.

# Progressive Decentralization

Many great blockchain projects begin with a centralized group. This gives the project crucial focus in building and spending, but a `DAO` needs **more than promises of decentralization**. On Optimism, the founders, network, and community are thought of as follows:

- 🏦 **Optimism Foundation:** The network founders. They kickstart the ecosystem, provide initial resources, and act as community steward, before eventually dissolving.
- 🌐 **Optimism Network:** The autonomous code on the blockchain — the smart contracts and processing of user input.
- 👬 **Optimism Collective:** The governing community; a diverse set of global participants. They are responsible for the long term ownership and management of the ecosystem. The term ‘DAO’ covers both the Collective and the Network.

Legal checks and balances, such as the Collective’s ability to remove members of the Foundation, ensure slow **transfer of network ownership to the community**.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/progressive-decentralization-e6e00611.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

True or false? The Optimism Foundation will continue to guide the Optimism Collective over the network’s lifetime.

- [ ] True

> ℹ️ Try again!

- [ ] False

> ℹ️ Correct! The Foundation will eventually dissolve, and the Collective will continue the mission.

# A New Economy

At the center of the Optimism `L2` economy is the **‘Optimistic Flywheel’**. This economic cycle generates revenue, network growth, and progress towards Optimism’s mission.

1. Users and `dApps` demand network `blockspace`.
2. The network generates revenue via transaction fees.
3. A portion of these taxes are awarded to builders providing impactful public goods infrastructure.
4. Network users gain access to free resources and services, increasing the value of OP blockspace.

With more valuable onchain infrastructure, demand for Optimism blockspace increases, and the cycle continues!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/a-new-economy-cd0a0ca1.svg)

# Incentivizing Public Goods

As you can see, `public goods` infrastructure is at the heart of Optimism. Yet selecting projects worthy of funding isn’t simple.

Here, Optimism takes an ‘**Impact = Profit**’ approach. Impact, however, is difficult to anticipate. Rather than making predictions, the funding body periodically looks over existing projects and assigns retroactive funding based on historic performance.

As Vitalik Buterin said, _“It’s easier to agree on what was useful than what will be useful.”_

This distribution model is known as **‘Retroactive Public Goods Funding’**, or **‘RetroPGF’**. This funding mechanism incentivizes optimistic thinkers to build public goods that are of service to humanity. It liberates us from the value-extraction mindset of traditional capitalist economies.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/incentivizing-public-goods-78035b95.svg)

# Ether’s Phoenix

Optimism calls this effect **‘Ether’s Phoenix’**: an _“angel reaching backwards in time, rewarding those who summon it.”_

_“It is an algorithm that rewards the early cooperators who created conditions for public goods funding to prosper. It is a future where early investment in public goods is recognized. It is also a mindset: that optimism prevails, that better systems are possible, and that humankind will be rewarded for its cooperative revolution.”_

— The Optimism Foundation

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/ethers-phoenix-f63f460c.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

How is Optimism incentivizing community-focused economics?

- [ ] By rewarding all Optimism projects with retroactive funding.

> ℹ️ Try again! Rewarding all projects regardless of their mission is not Optimism’s approach.

- [ ] By providing a free market, but on the blockchain.

> ℹ️ Try again! Use of blockchain technology alone doesn’t effect economic models.

- [ ] By systemically funding business models that improve the lives of all network users.

> ℹ️ Correct! The network allocates a portion of transaction fees towards funding public goods.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  Try again! Only one of these is true.

# Introducing the Governing Houses

There are two houses that make up the Optimism Collective, each with independent and shared responsibilities in running the network.

**The Token House** is responsible for managing network upgrades, incentives, and treasury. Its stakeholder structure incentivizes growth of the network economy, and generates stakeholder value. The house is also responsible for preserving decentralization — preventing capture of the network economy.

**The Citizens’ House** allocates `RetroPGF` resources to community projects, according to the ‘Impact = Profit’ ethos, and helps decide the parameters of citizenship. The house is incentivized to improve network quality of life, by funding public goods that improve the value of citizenship!

Both houses maintain network balance through their duties, voting mechanics, and `veto` abilities. Let’s take a closer look.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/introducing-the-governing-houses-bdcf1e8f.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

How does the Citizens’ House differ from the Token House?

- [ ] The Citizens’ House is the only house with veto abilities.

> ℹ️ Try again! Both houses have veto powers.

- [ ] The Citizens’ House allocates RetroPGF rewards.

> ℹ️ Correct! The Citizens’ House allocates public goods funding.

- [ ] The Citizens’ House leads network decentralization.

> ℹ️  Try again! Both houses maintain decentralization.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  Try again!

# The Token House

The Token House maintains the economy and defenses of the Optimism Network.

Duties include:

- ⚒️ Review and approval of **upgrades to network mechanics**.
- ⛓️ Selection of network `block producers`.
- 📈 **Allocation of revenue,** using collected transaction fees to fuel network growth.

To protect the network, the Citizens’ House has the right to `veto` any proposal under the above categories.

The Token House also has the ability to veto any proposal submitted by the Citizens’ House, or the Optimism Foundation, which is seen to be reducing rights of token holders.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/the-token-house-7d73ce82.svg)

# Token House: Joining, Voting, Delegating

📝 **Joining:** the Token House is done via purchasing and holding OP tokens. These are `ERC-20` tokens, and are therefore transferrable; They can be bought and sold on `CEXs`, Optimism `DEXs`, or sent between friends. OP tokens are not available on other networks.

🗳️ **Voting:** Voting power scales based on how many tokens are held.

The Token House follows [a five week voting cycle](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/token-house-history/):

- Week 1-3: Proposal submission, review, and feedback.
- Week 4-5: Voting.

📢 **Delegating:** Many users prefer to `delegate` their voting power to other token holders who they feel best represent the community’s interests. This is a great way to have an impact on the ecosystem without having to read every proposal that enters voting. Delegation does not affect token ownership — delegated OP tokens stay in your wallet.

Anyone can become a Token House delegate on Optimism, representing a group of friends, a community, or even a university’s blockchain club! Active delegates are often rewarded by the community.

# A Note on Token Distribution…

Network governance is only as democratic as its initial `token distribution`. We should always ask “who received voting power in the first place?” and “how much did they receive?”.

Check out the [OP distribution plan](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#allocations-at-a-glance) to see how the Optimism Foundation has allocated initial governance power, in service of balanced stakeholder representation.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/a-note-on-token-distribution-cb74efa7.svg)

# Knowledge Check 6

How does the Token House protect the network from attack?

- [ ] By selecting a diverse set of network block producers.

> ℹ️ This is true, but it isn’t the only answer.

- [ ] By vetoing Optimism Foundation proposals seen to be reducing token holder rights.

> ℹ️ This is true, but it isn’t the only answer.

- [ ] By carefully reviewing network upgrade proposals.

> ℹ️ This is true, but it isn’t the only answer.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ℹ️  Correct! The Token House has a diverse set of responsibilities in protecting the network.

# The Citizens’ House

The Citizens’ House conducts the growth of public infrastructure on the Optimism Network. It’s primary focus is managing Retroactive Public Goods Funding.

Duties include:

- 🎯 **Defining RetroPGF metrics and impact criteria** for measuring project performance.
- 🔍 **Research and allocation of RetroPGF** to community projects which meet the guidelines.
- 👬 **Selection of new citizens** to help govern the Citizens’ House, and balance Token House perspective. The Token House has veto rights for this type of proposal.

The Citizens’ House also ensures that Token House proposals are mission-aligned, using `veto` mechanics to waive unaligned changes to the network.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/the-citizens-house-aa93f52c.svg)

# Citizens’ House: Joining, Voting, Delegating

📝 **Joining:** The Citizens’ House currently adds members by invitation, to slowly scale and refine its processes. Membership is marked by holding a ‘Citizen Badge’ — a non-transferable `ERC-721` token.

The specifics of invitations change seasonally based on experimentation by the Optimism Foundation:

- Current Citizens may be granted an additional invitation, to be shared with someone they see as a great addition to the network.
- Previous RetroPGF recipients have been granted the opportunity to select one community member for Citizen status.
- The Optimism Foundation has issued Citizenship to project builders using the network.

As the scaling methods are refined, growth will be automated via `onchain governance`.

🗳️ **Voting:** Each Citizen has a single vote. Their voting power cannot be transferred or delegated. This protects against gathering of House power under a small number of Citizens.

At present, RetroPGF distribution occurs roughly twice per year.

# Knowledge Check 7

How does the Citizens’ House protect the network from attack?

- [ ] By expanding the number of Citizens’ House members.

> ℹ️ This is true, but it isn’t the only answer.

- [ ] By vetoing unaligned Token House proposals.

> ℹ️ This is true, but it isn’t the only answer.

- [ ] Both of the above.

> ℹ️  Correct! This house diversifies its own perspective, and balances Token House perspective.

# Governance Seasons

Optimism takes **an iterative approach to governance**, using a calendar structure referred to as ‘Seasons’.

By moving between periods of active governance and reflection, participants gain firsthand experience followed by digestion and discussion of current governance practices. The model is then improved by the Optimism Foundation, and the next season begins.

On Optimism a season lasts roughly three months, followed by a reflection period of similar length.

These thoughtful feedback loops, built throughout Optimism’s systems, are incredibly important for building governance best practices in `DAO` communities.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/optimism-governance/governance-seasons-4ebc291c.svg)

# Now… Think Even Bigger!

We’re almost ready to govern on Optimism 🔴. There’s one last thing to mention.

The Optimistic Vision doesn’t stop at a single `L2` blockchain. As result of the ability to `fork` a blockchain, this is a cloneable governance experiment. This technology is built to be scaled across multiple L2s — and even into real world governance scenarios. Optimism calls this **‘The Superchain’**.

Coinbase, a prominent `CEX`, has already forked and started contributing to this `open source` initiative, through the Base 🔵 L2 blockchain. This collaborative pooling of development resources increases infrastructure evolution, while funneling L2 transaction fees towards Optimism’s ‘Impact = Profit’ ethos.

RetroPGF rewards now include profits from Base 🔵 transaction fees — which means more funding for `public goods`!

# Shaping an Optimistic Future

History has always been paved by the optimists of humanity — those that dared to think big, and act to achieve their vision.

By getting involved in innovative communities, using `trustless` and fair governance systems, we are trailblazing the future of human coordination. We are building a world where humanity can thrive in local, global, and online systems. It’s time to start our Optimism governance journey.

Today’s quest is **to join the Token House and delegate our OP tokens**.

While the Citizens’ House develops its onboarding procedures, we can begin our Citizen journey by participating in conversation on the [Optimism community](https://gov.optimism.io/) forums.
