# 欢迎来到 Bankless 学院

欢迎您，大胆的探索者，来到数字创新的前沿。

在 Bankless 学院，我们的使命是为像你这样的探索者提供最好的工具和知识，让你们能够驾驭区块链世界，"无银行化 - Bankless！"

今天，我们来看看开创这一切的 "加密货币（Crypto）"：比特币。

比特币是一种新类型的钱。 它提升了持有者的财务自由程度，并保护他们的血汗钱不会随着时间的推移而贬值。

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/bitcoin-basics/welcome-to-bankless-academy-cc6189d4.png)

# 比特币的故事

2009 年，神秘的 "中本聪（Satoshi Nakamoto） "推出了比特币，标志着一个新经济时代的开始。

作为第一种成功的 "加密货币"，比特币开启了一场声势浩大的对话：货币的控制权和权力是否应继续由传统银行系统掌握？ 又或是它应属于每日赚取并使用它的公民？ 如果您不清楚这一切的讨论背后意味着什么，那末您来对地方了！

事实上，我们并不像我们自己想象的那样对自己使用的货币有足够的控制权。 这产生了非常现实的后果。

是时候了解比特币如何革命金融了。

**现在是重新审视货币的最佳良机。**

# A Brief History of Money

Money has been an integral part of society since our earliest days when beads, shells, and stones were used to exchange goods & services.

然而，早期的货币有一个问题：有人想找到/创造新的货币太简单了。 这种货币越多，它蕴含的价值就越低。因此，每个人的钱都会慢慢变得不值钱。 如果货币想要保值，就需要使用更稀有的材料。

最终，人们采用金银等材料来解决这一问题。 这些材料的主要优势在于其稀缺性 —— 没有无穷无尽的供应，因此任何人都很难大幅增加流通中的货币总量。 这种 "稀缺性 "有助于维持货币的价值。

随着社会的发展，政府的中央银行会发行标准化的金、银币。 这类货币使货币具有可识别性和可衡量性，同时又是一种强有力的价值贮存手段。

# Knowledge Check 1

真或假：
"货币体系中的货币越多，现有货币的价值就越低"。

- [ ] 真

> 正确 ！ 货币总量越多，单位货币价值越低。

- [ ] 错误

> 再试一次

# 货币简史（第二部分）

随着现代纸币的出现，货币转而变为被黄金“支撑（backed）”的纸币。 货币价值与贵金属贮存的具体数量直接挂钩。

进入 20 世纪后，"金本位（以黄金为基准支撑） "开始衰落。

贵金属慢慢地与全球货币脱钩 —— 这允许各国的经济增长（以纸币计价）超过其黄金供应量。 As a central bank no longer needed gold to create currency, they could create as much new money as they deemed necessary for their country’s economy. By firmly controlling the money supply, they could also control its value.

Moving into the digital age, electronic currency has vastly replaced physical currency. Storing our money with commercial banks has given us the convenience of credit cards and payment apps. While easy and secure, it also puts for-profit businesses between people and their money.

# The Problem

The problem with our current financial system is the lack of control we have over our money, and how this lowers our ability to freely decide what to save and what to spend.

`Central banks`, the bank managing a country’s `monetary policy`, can introduce any amount of new money. This lack of `scarcity` often makes our money worth less and less each year. Money with an unpredictable, decreasing value often forces us to spend it: **“If my money is going to be worth less every year, why save? I might as well spend it now.”** 💸

`Commercial banks`, those used for everyday saving and spending, also influence our spending habits. As a `custodian`, they can block transactions or confiscate our funds. Some banks have blocked their clients from buying cryptocurrency! **If your bank can freeze your life savings at any time… do you truly own your money?** 💸

***

For money to once again support financial freedom, it must regain the two key properties it has lost over time:

- 💎 **Value:** Money must reliably store its worth over time.
- ✊ **Ownership:** Money must be easy to store and protect ourselves.

Only these qualities can restore our ability to freely save and spend our money.

# Enter Bitcoin

`Satoshi Nakamoto` thought that money was too important to be controlled by just a few people. He wanted to create a type of money that could be fair and reliable for everyone.

Enter Bitcoin (`BTC`): a digital currency that operates beyond the traditional banking system.

- ⛓️ It’s `peer-to-peer`: It connects people directly to each other. Automated using `blockchain technology`, it removes need for institutions to facilitate storage or transactions. Advocates call it “a set of rules with no rulers”.
- 💎 It’s `scarce`: With no central bank issuing unlimited new money, Bitcoin has a stable, predictable monetary policy that honors long-term saving.
- ✊ It’s `self-custodial`: It can be held without institutions hosting transfers or storage. When stored in its natural state, Bitcoin is held in a secure online safe and only the owner has access.

For its qualities, Bitcoin has earned the nickname “digital gold”.

# Digital Gold: Scarcity

📉 Do you find it difficult to keep up with rising costs?

***

Scarcity in Bitcoin refers to there being a cap on how many Bitcoins can ever exist — a maximum of 21 million. This `max supply` is embedded in its code, making Bitcoin rare and potentially valuable. This puts it in a good position as a long term store of value, much like gold.

While the max supply of `BTC` can’t exceed 21 million, new currency is added to the market at regular intervals. Much like mining gold, new Bitcoin is introduced through a laborious process called `cryptocurrency mining`. This predictable increase in `circulating supply` keeps the Bitcoin economy moving.

Bitcoin's fixed `monetary policy` makes it an attractive asset for those seeking to preserve value in the long term, allowing them to keep up with rising costs.

It’s short term value remains volatile due to market speculation.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/bitcoin-basics/digital-gold-scarcity-8c8905f7.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

How does Bitcoin promote value preservation in the long term?

- [ ] Using a max supply cap.

> Correct! Bitcoin's fixed supply creates scarcity similar to precious metals. This aids value retention.

- [ ] By removing custodians.

> Try again! Custody relates to ownership, rather than value.

# Digital Gold: Self-Custody

🧊 Has your bank frozen your funds without notice because you performed a transfer that they didn’t like?

***

In democracies, ownership is a protected human right because it gives citizens increased control and freedom over their lives. We cannot act freely when our means of survival are conditional — judged by businesses or institutions.

As our assets are increasingly digitized (i.e. your money, your property, and even your identity), our lives are taking on a digital quality that we must learn to protect.

Bitcoin’s `self-custody` offers true digital ownership, beyond reach of `custodians`. So long as you don’t share your account information with someone else, you have sole access to your assets. It’s like having your own vault of gold in a secure online space.

This system of ownership gives you total control of your digital wealth — anywhere in the world, any time.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/bitcoin-basics/digital-gold-self-custody-18bd7ba3.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

How does self-custody enable true ownership?

- [ ] By giving you sole access to your assets.

> Correct! Anyone with access to our assets has the ability to confiscate them.

- [ ] By allowing custodians to access to your assets.

> Try again! Self-custody means there is no custodian (third party) that can access our assets.

# Bitcoin: It’s like Emailing Money!

⌛ Have you ever had to wait several working days to send money internationally, while paying 3-5% in fees?

***

Email simplified sending letters by removing the need for a post office. In a similar way, Bitcoin has streamlined sending money by removing the need for banks.

- ⚡ Transfer Bitcoin globally for a reasonable fee.
- ⚙️ Send money 24/7. No waiting, no paperwork, no downtime.
- 📡 Access Bitcoin from anywhere with an internet connection.

In the same way that you have an email address, a single Bitcoin address is necessary to receive Bitcoin. By default it looks like this: _1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa_ (we’ll show you how to customize this later!)

You’ll manage your account using `cryptocurrency wallet` software connected to your web browser or your phone. It’s the easiest “bank account” you’ll ever set up. No appointment or ID required!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/bitcoin-basics/bitcoin-its-like-emailing-money-2e2fb8ad.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

How is Bitcoin similar to email?

- [ ] Both are online 24/7.

> Right! But this isn’t the only correct answer.

- [ ] Both are digital technologies.

> Right! But this isn’t the only correct answer.

- [ ] Both can be accessed with a phone.

> Right! But this isn’t the only correct answer.

- [ ] All of the above.

> Correct! Both Bitcoin and email innovate on the services that came before them.

# The Bitcoin Network

Let’s switch gears and look at the engine behind Bitcoin:
**The Bitcoin Network**.

Bitcoin runs on a shared network hosted across thousands of computers worldwide. Every computer in the network plays a role in maintaining its operations; the network exists through these computers! If one computer processes a fraudulent transaction, the others are there to correct it.

This also means there’s no single point to apply pressure in attempted hacks. In order for the network to be controlled, a majority of the computers would need to be compromised.

This defense strategy is called `decentralization`: the shifting of control from one central group to many smaller ones. It’s what makes cryptocurrency networks virtually unstoppable.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/bitcoin-basics/the-bitcoin-network-eda52e60.svg)

# Bitcoin Mining

With the Bitcoin Network having no central bank, the network relies on its `decentralized` participants. Known as `miners`, these participants are constantly checking transactions and adding them to a “database” — the `blockchain`.

It’s important that these miners are motivated to be active and honest, to protect the network from fraud. Miners frequently double-check each other’s results, but are also rewarded for the work they do. When we submit Bitcoin transactions, we pay a small fee that goes to the miner of our transaction. Miners also earn new Bitcoin, known as “block rewards”, for their work.

These rewards slowly increase Bitcoin’s `circulating supply` within the `max supply` cap of 21 million `BTC`.

It’s the slow, predictable introduction of new coins that separates Bitcoin from traditional currencies. Everything is managed by community-approved computer code — “rules with no rulers” — and decentralized participants, rather than small groups of people at the `central bank`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/bitcoin-basics/bitcoin-mining-9b8a77ea.svg)

# Sending a Bitcoin Transaction

Understanding the exact mechanisms that power Bitcoin transactions and mining can get quite complicated. That said, using and sending Bitcoin is simple!

We’ll take a simplified view of the process for today:

1. You submit a transaction using your `cryptocurrency wallet`, sending 0.1 `BTC` to your friend’s wallet address.
2. A miner checks your transaction for errors. Other miners double-check their results.
3. If approved, your transaction is added to the `blockchain` “database”.
4. Your friend receives 0.1 BTC in their wallet.

# Knowledge Check 5

What is decentralization?

- [ ] Increased scarcity.

> Try again! Scarcity means an asset is in low supply.

- [ ] Distribution of control across multiple participants.

> Correct! This distribution protects the network and its users.

- [ ] The rewards earned by miners.

> Try again! Miners are rewarded with transaction fees and block rewards.

# Knowledge Check 6

How does mining protect the Bitcoin Network from fraud?

- [ ] By rewarding miners for checking transactions.

> Correct! Bitcoin rewards attract miners and incentivize them to act honestly.

- [ ] By increasing the circulating supply of Bitcoin.

> Try again! Supply increases don’t help to prevent fraud.

- [ ] Both of the above.

> Try again! Only one of the above helps to prevent fraud.

# The Innovation of Money

In this lesson, we’ve looked at how Bitcoin’s scarcity helps it retain value, and how institutional management of our assets means giving up full ownership.

However Bitcoin has evolved beyond a simple monetary tool. It has become a catalyst for a `decentralized money` revolution. This movement reimagines the traditional financial system by distributing monetary power and control to those who use it.

By decentralizing money and removing `custodians` we can:

- 💵 Host a 24/7 global marketplace, secured by citizens around the world.
- 🛠️ Offer financial tools to the unbanked regions of the globe.
- 🤝 Use `peer-to-peer` technology to avoid the inefficiencies of middleman institutions.
- 🔎 Reduce institutional inequality, fraud and market manipulation.
- ⚖️ Build `equality of opportunity` into monetary systems.
- 🌐 Establish true ownership for the digital age.

The new era of money is championing the fundamental values of democracy to increase quality of everyday life for citizens around the globe — and you’re invited.

“_Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.” — United Nations._

# Your Bitcoin Quest

It’s time to simulate your first Bitcoin transaction and practice your freedom in the digital age.

Your transaction will include the following details:

📫 The wallet address of the person you’re sending to.

💰 The amount of Bitcoin to send.

It will also include a transaction fee given to the `miners`.

Remember to make sure all details are accurate.
Once a Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, you cannot reverse it.
