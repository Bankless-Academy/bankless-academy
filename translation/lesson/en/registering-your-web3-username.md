## Key Takeaways

> * Using the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), you can create a single username that represents you across multiple blockchains.
>
> * ENS names simplify sending and receiving `cryptocurrency` by replacing your lengthy wallet address with a memorable label like *web3explorer.eth*
>
> * Your ENS names become associated with your online presence: your cryptocurrency portfolio, your blockchain interactions, social media pages, avatars, websites, and emails, forming a single `onchain identity`.
>
> * Registering an ENS name is similar to registering a .com website address. It requires a `cryptocurrency wallet` and 10 minutes.

## Introducing Universal Usernames

Imagine having a single username for the entire internet. One account for your entire online presence ‚Äî an account that you own and plug into other apps across the internet. This username would serve as your digital personality, allowing you to be recognized across the internet, making you a unique, memorable member of the online community.

Projects like the [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains) are building this single username reality, leveraging the powers of cryptocurrency wallets. Using ENS, your `custodial wallet` address can be transformed into a personalized address of your choosing, with a `.eth` extension.

*0xB00e26E79352882391604E24b371A3F3c8658e8c* ‚Üí *web3explorer.eth*

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-c7baff43.png)

Just like a .com website address, it‚Äôs easy to read, memorable, and personalized to you. No matter where on the internet you are, your name will be consistent and recognizable. Sending `cryptocurrency` to your wallet no longer requires saving, copying and pasting a lengthy address.

And this is just the beginning.

> *Originally we envisioned ENS as a naming system to name crypto addresses.. (but) as web3 users, the meaning of an address is so much more, it can be your Farcaster id, your crypto payment address, a DAO contract and more.*
>
> *The use cases of web3 are expanding and if we want the next billion people to be onboarded onto web3, it needs to be usable. When all these things are properly named, web3 becomes usable, it becomes human.*
>
> *ENS makes web3 human.*
>
> *‚Äî Jefflau.eth, Core Developer at ENS Labs*

By linking your wallet address to a unique .eth username, you‚Äôve actually created a web3 personality with the ownership powers of a custodial wallet. ENS names can support wallets across multiple networks. One universal name is now linked to your digital property across blockchains, your blockchain history, and more. This includes any special credentials you may have unlocked ‚Äî **like your Bankless Academy badges.**

## Onchain Identity

The capabilities of ENS extend beyond labelling wallet addresses; ENS can label almost any entity or asset on the blockchain, like a `smart contract`, and point to any location on the `web2` internet. Your website, social media profiles, and email can all be associated with this single username.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-7086002e.png)

Picture ENS as **your onchain passport**. A physical passport contains your name, photo, birth date, and passport number, linking to extensive information in your government‚Äôs identity database. ENS maps your .eth domain (`yourname.eth`) with an Ethereum address, a profile picture, `onchain` data like trades and governance votes, and `offchain` data like your website.

Here‚Äôs the key difference: You own and control all aspects of this onchain passport.

ENS names are represented as NFT tokens (`ERC-721` tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain, which are owned by and managed through your custodial wallet ‚Äî **just like cryptocurrency.** In web3, you can truly own your online identity and carry it with you around the internet. Your account ‚Äî its data, content, followers etc. ‚Äî can‚Äôt be erased by the platforms you use. We‚Äôre moving beyond the control of YouTube, Instagram, and the other web2 giants managing the internet community.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-073b8d76.png)

Let‚Äôs take a look at how our ENS names plug into onchain apps, starting with the Bankless Academy ‚ÄòExplorer Profile‚Äô feature. As a Bankless Academy user with an ENS name, you will automatically find your ENS name and profile picture represented on [your profile](https://app.banklessacademy.com/explorer/my-profile). This information is displayed alongside your Academy achievements ‚Äî like lesson badges and collected content.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-09c3d858.png)

Another example is Farcaster, a decentralized social network. Instead of requiring users to create a new social account, it allows them to connect their wallet and leverage their existing ENS name along with its associated data. This approach enriches the Farcaster social graph with existing information, showcasing practicality of ENS in decentralized identity management.

> **Fun fact:** As of this writing, ENS has registered nearly 2,070,797 domains, as per [Dune Analytics data](https://dune.com/ethereumnameservice/ens). That‚Äôs close to the population of Houston, Texas. üêÇ

It's time to become an onchain citizen and shape our decentralized future. It‚Äôs time to register your ENS name. We'll guide you through the process, helping you to unlock its key features, including assigning your profile picture for visibility across numerous onchain apps like Bankless Academy.

The process is very similar to registering a .com website address on a platform like GoDaddy or Google Domains. It‚Äôs as simple as choosing a unique name and submitting two blockchain transactions.

## Prerequisites

**1\. Create a Crypto Wallet**

To buy and hold your ENS name, you'll need to set up a wallet if you haven't already done so. Check out our quick guide, [‚ÄòCreating a Crypto Wallet‚Äô](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/creating-a-crypto-wallet), and create your wallet in 5 minutes.

**2\. Ensure You Have ETH in Your Wallet on the Ethereum Mainnet**

You can fund your wallet by sending cryptocurrency from a Centralized Exchange, or by using services like [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com/en-gb) or [Transak](https://global.transak.com/). As another option, you can also pay for an ENS name using a credit or debit card.

## Walkthrough

**1\. Open the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains/)** **and connect your wallet.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-2297867c.png)

**2\. Search for and select your desired name.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-4d71d393.png)

**3\. Choose the duration of your registration.**

You‚Äôll need to periodically renew your ENS name. Be sure to set a reminder in your personal calendar to notify you before it expires.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-0e183437.png)

**4\. Select your payment method.**

You can use the balance in your Ethereum wallet, or pay with a credit/debit card.

**Optional:** Set your domain as your `primary name` during this phase. This means your ENS name and profile picture will be displayed instead of your lengthy wallet address on Bankless Academy, Farcaster and other ENS-supported platforms.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-91795816.png)

**5\. Review the upcoming registration steps.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-d312b342.png)

**6\. Start the 60 second timer by signing the first transaction.**

This first transaction prevents others from `front-running` your registration process.

![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gz4ZTiKop-ncbvPL3yjXz.png?height=1127&width=1440)

**7\. Wait for the timer to finish.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-0f779c34.png)

**8\. Sign the second transaction.**

This is the transaction that will secure ownership of your new ENS name, and send it to your wallet.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-b83971f6.png)

**9\. Success!**

Your ENS name will now be represented as an `ERC-721` token in your wallet.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/registering-your-web3-username/image-ea2d6d2a.png)

You can verify that your ENS name redirects to your wallet address by visiting <https://etherscan.io/> and entering your ENS name in the address search bar; note that this process might take a few minutes. Once this is working, your ENS name is ready to be shared with your friends and plugged into Ethereum apps.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **What is a Primary Name?**

Your `primary name` functions as a nickname for your onchain wallet address, simplifying your complex Ethereum wallet address. By assigning a primary name, you allow various apps to use and display it, along with your profile picture. [Learn more here](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7890756-the-primary-name#)!

### **Can I link my email, website, or social media to my ENS name?**

Yes, absolutely! Just as your passport can hold different details about you, your ENS name can link to a variety of personal data. This includes your email, personal website, profile picture, and social media handles.

These `standard records` allow you to publicly share your contact information in a decentralized way. They‚Äôre stored onchain and accessible via any application that recognizes ENS names.

For a beginner-friendly guide on setting records for your ENS name and what each type of record could be used for, please refer to this [article](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7890802-set-a-record).

### **How much does it cost to register an ENS Name?**

Currently, the registration costs for ENS names are set at the following prices:

* Names with 5 or more characters: $5 in ETH per year.

* Names with 4 characters: $160 in ETH per year.

* Names with 3 characters: $640 in ETH per year.

This doesn‚Äôt include transaction `gas fees` for interacting with the Ethereum Network, which are roughly estimated in the [ENS Manager App](https://app.ens.domains/). Additional gas fees are required for onchain data updates like setting `custom records`. Prices for shorter names are higher due to scarcity. Fees deter speculative registrations and support the DAO's development of ENS.

### Can I connect multiple wallet addresses with a single ENS name?

Absolutely! Your ENS name can either map several wallet addresses to a single ENS name, like 'yourname.eth', or you can sort your addresses into separate subnames to identify the type of cryptocurrency associated with each, like 'ethereum.yourname.eth' or 'bitcoin.yourname.eth'.

You can set up either option using the [ENS Manager App](https://ens.app). For more details, [refer to this guide for step-by-step instructions](https://support.ens.domains/en/articles/7900302-ens-use-cases)

### Can I use my existing website address as my ENS name?

Yes, if you own a website like [web3explorer.com](http://web3explorer.com), you can use this instead of web3explorer.eth. This is thanks to infrastructure co-built by ENS and GoDaddy.
