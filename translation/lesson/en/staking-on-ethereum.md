# Staking on Ethereum

Welcome, Explorer, to your next lesson!

Today, we‚Äôll look at the process of ‚Äústaking‚Äù ‚Äî one simple way to build digital wealth.

`Staking` is similar to `mining` on the Bitcoin network: they‚Äôre both systems for letting participants process transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. They keep our networks `decentralized`.

However, there‚Äôs an important difference between mining and staking. Staking on Ethereum doesn‚Äôt require a powerful computer to compete against others. Simply locking Ether (ETH) in a network `smart contract` keeps Ethereum running and rewards you.

# Ethereum Wants You!

Think of `staking` like an ‚Äúinternet bond‚Äù.

Just like supporting your government through bonds gives financial returns, supporting Ethereum brings rewards! Even better, like government bonds, staking is a way to show financial support for your values and the world you want to live in.

When you stake Ether, it is assigned to a `validator node` working to process transactions on Ethereum. The more Ether staked, the more nodes Ethereum can have. With more nodes, Ethereum becomes more `decentralized` and secure.

As a `staker`, you become a **guardian of Ethereum!**

Now, let's take a deep look into staking mechanics and discover a stress-free and low-cost opportunity to start your staking journey today.

Grab your gear, let‚Äôs go!

# Blockchain Security

`Validator nodes` are key to a secure and legitimate economy on Ethereum. They protect the blockchain from `fraud`.

Fraud in the blockchain world looks like a user manipulating balances or creating non-existent crypto. Ethereum‚Äôs way of curbing it is ensuring that every transaction is valid and no participant has power over others. This fairness, known as `credible neutrality`, is vital. Why? Nobody wants to be a part of an economy where there's deceit and distrust ‚Äî it will eventually collapse.

In a healthy blockchain, validator nodes share one goal: **to** **reach decentralized agreement‚Äîacross the network‚Äîon the state of the blockchain.** Nodes scan transactions, check them against the blockchain‚Äôs history, and vote on their validity. Transactions that pass node `consensus` as valid are added to the blockchain.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/blockchain-security-7f2149fe.svg)

# Knowledge Check 1

How do validator nodes prevent fraud on Ethereum?

- [ ] By overpowering each other.

> Try again! Nodes have no influence over each other. They work together to influence the blockchain.

- [ ] By creating non-existent crypto for certain people.

> Try again! This would be committing fraud.

- [ ] By reaching decentralized agreement on valid transactions.

> Correct! Nodes agree on the state of the blockchain.

# Proof-of-Stake

Users who want to run a `validator node` on their computer must gather and lock 32 ETH ‚Äî that‚Äôs a lot of money. In exchange for taking a large financial ‚Äústake‚Äù in the network, the `node operator` is allowed to propose and review blocks of transactions on Ethereum ‚Äî and earn rewards. Think of blocks as groups of transactions submitted to the network.

The network‚Äôs `consensus mechanism` randomly selects a validator node to propose the next block and its decision is double-checked by other nodes to ensure honesty. When a node successfully proposes a block, its `stake` grows.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/proof-of-stake-49c358ed.svg)

# Slashing

When a node is too slow or tries to approve fraud, its stake is `slashed`: it gets a penalty charge. This way, staked Ether becomes a form of insurance where nodes are incentivized to be honest and keep Ethereum running smoothly.

For an attacker to approve fraud on Ethereum, they must have control over majority of the validator nodes and thus, staked Ether. Fortunately this can't happen if everyday users are involved in staking. `Decentralized` ownership of the network divides the power to make decisions.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/slashing-ccabe137.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

True or False: Validator nodes caught processing fraudulent blocks will receive penalty charges.

- [ ] True

> Correct! This ‚Äúslashing‚Äù incentivizes nodes to stay honest!

- [ ] False

> Try again! Nodes must receive some sort of punishment for dishonest actions.

# Validating Transactions

Let's get into the step-by-step process of how nodes come to agreement using `Proof-of-Stake` consensus:

1. **Staking:** A `node operator` locks 32 ETH on the network and begins running a `validator node`.
2. **Block Building:** Users submit transactions ordered into `blocks` by `block builders`.
3. **Proposer Selection:** An algorithm selects a validator node to propose the next block to be added to the blockchain.
4. **Block Proposal:** The `block proposer` reviews potential blocks and selects one, granting their `attestation` if valid.
5. **Cross-Verification:** Other validators double-check the block and grant attestation if valid. Invalid blocks are discarded and the proposer is `slashed`.
6. **Block Addition:** The valid block is added to the Ethereum blockchain.
7. **Rewards:** The block proposer earns a `block reward` and transaction tips. The other validators are also rewarded.

# Knowledge Check 3

What is the name of the validator node selecting the next block to be added to Ethereum?

- [ ] Staker

> Try again! Stakers support validator nodes, but don‚Äôt run the node themselves.

- [ ] Block builder

> Try again! Block builders order incoming transactions into potential blocks, but don‚Äôt add them to the blockchain.

- [ ] Block proposer

> Correct! Block proposers, looking at blocks from block builders, choose one to add to the blockchain.

# Ethernomics

For providing Ether to a validator node, stakers earn a portion of its rewards.

Rewards received by nodes are based on various ecosystem factors and can change. Simply put, the rewards are a portion of transaction fees and a small amount of newly issued Ether added to new blocks.

Annual yield can look like anything between a 3% to 16% return on staked Ether. The exact amount is based on two key factors:

- üìà **Network Activity:** Generally speaking, if traffic is low rewards are lower. If traffic is high, they‚Äôre higher.
- üë• **Number of Validator Nodes:** Rewards get further divided with more participants.

Yields also change depending on how exactly you stake your Ether. Let‚Äôs look at our options.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/ethernomics-33407ddc.svg)

# Types of Staking

You‚Äôll typically need to lock 32 ETH to run a `validator node`, but new staking methods have made guarding Ethereum available to everyone.

So, there are three ways to protect Ethereum:

- üì° **Solo Staking:** Run a validator node yourself.
- ‚õ≤ **Staking Pools:** Join a group of stakers and run a node together.
- üè¶ **Centralized Exchange Staking:** Join a ‚Äúcrypto bank‚Äù node.

Each method requires varying levels of technical knowledge to get set up, along with its own associated risks.

If you‚Äôre comfortable holding your `private keys` but don‚Äôt have 32 ETH, then consider joining others in a staking pool. 

If you‚Äôre not yet okay with taking `self-custody` of your crypto, check out Centralized Exchange staking. In the mean time, take our [Wallet Basics](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lessons/wallet-basics) lesson and boldly take ownership of your crypto!

# Types of Staking (Part 2)

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-part-2-9de268fd.svg)

**Solo Staking**

üü° Requires 32 ETH

üü° Technical Setup

üü¢ Decentralizes Ethereum

**Risks:** You may lose your private keys, get `slashed`, or receive minor penalties for an offline node.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-part-2-96f11caf.svg)

**Staking Pools**

üü¢ Any amount of ETH

üü¢ Easy Setup

üü° Decentralized Options

**Risks:** There could be a bug in the staking pool‚Äôs smart contract or you may lose your private keys.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-part-2-27091ef5.svg)

**Centralized Exchange Staking**

üü¢ Any amount of ETH

üü¢ Easy Setup

üî¥ Centralizes Ethereum

**Risks:** Your exchange could declare bankruptcy ‚Äî this may lead to loss of your holdings.

# Network Centralization

**Any staking that leads to many nodes under one entity begins to centralize Ethereum.**

Imagine Ethereum as a web of connected `validator nodes`. When nodes are concentrated under one or a few entities, the entire web becomes imbalanced and unsafe. For this not to happen, we need lots of unique connection points.

A single entity gaining control over enough nodes is bad. This forces blocks of transactions through the centralized section of the web. The centralized entity could begin approving fraudulent blocks, or even denying valid ones. This would destroy Ethereum‚Äôs `credible neutrality`.

As its guardians, we must focus on staking methods that keep the web balanced and `decentralized`.

You may face many barriers with running your own validator node as a beginner. Instead, let's explore a beginner-friendly option to decentralized staking: `staking pools`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/network-centralization-0622ba07.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

What would happen if a single entity controlled a majority of validator nodes?

- [ ] They could approve blocks including fraudulent transactions.

> Correct! Ethereum would lose its credible neutrality.

- [ ] They would gain control of all validator nodes.

> Try again! Other nodes cannot be controlled, but their voice can be overpowered.

- [ ] Ethereum would stop processing transactions altogether.

> Try again! Ethereum wouldn‚Äôt stop running during such an attack, but its credible neutrality would be lost.

- [ ] All of the above.

> Try again! Only one of the above answers is correct.

# Staking Pools

The best part about `staking pools` is that they‚Äôre entirely run by `smart contracts`. You don‚Äôt have to meet the other stakers in person and you don‚Äôt have to trust them. You do however have to trust the smart contract.

Staking pools are organized by `staking providers`, digital platforms connecting stakers across the world! In staking pools, a `node operator` stakes at least 16 ETH and runs the node, while other participants supply the remaining Ether. The node operator earns extra yield for their service.

The remaining staking participants are given ‚ÄúLiquid Staking Tokens‚Äù (LSTs) representing their membership to the pool. These `tokens` stand for a share of a pool‚Äôs staked Ether. The holder earns a portion of rewards equal to the represented stake, and can use them to redeem their stake at any time.

By simply holding an LST‚Äîlike Rocket Pool‚Äôs rETH‚Äîyou own a share of a staking pool. Yep, your Ether is decentralizing Ethereum and earning staking rewards!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/staking-pools-46c96251.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

Which entity hosts the staking pool?

- [ ] The node operator.

> Try again! Node operators run the validator node, but not the pool itself.

- [ ] The remaining staking participants.

> Try again! Stakers provide Ether, but don‚Äôt run the pool.

- [ ] The staking provider.

> Correct! The pool is hosted through the provider‚Äôs smart contracts.

# Liquid Staking Tokens

The best thing about `LSTs` is that even while your Ether is staked and gathering yield, it maintains a `liquid` form.

‚ÄúLiquid‚Äù in this case means that it can still flow throughout the ecosystem. Think of holding a share of a staking pool‚Ä¶ but you can use it as money! LSTs can be swapped, used as collateral for loans, or even deposited on `restaking` platforms for bonus yield.

LSTs are great because they open access to staked Ether. Staking pools often have minimum deposit amounts for adding Ether to the pool (around 0.01 ETH). However, using LSTs, you can buy even smaller increments of staked Ether on your favorite `decentralized exchange`.

# Network Centralization ‚Äî Again!

Staking pools and LSTs have the same catch as the different staking methods: **they function in different degrees of centralization and decentralization.**

Staking providers like Rocket Pool have made sure that anyone, anywhere can be the `node operator` of a staking pool. This supports new node operators in building their 32 ETH stake, and helps to decentralize Ethereum. However, other providers only allow a small range of their contacts to run their nodes, making the centralization of staked Ether a risk.

If any entity gains over 33% control of all staked Ether, they could cause problems on the network. At 50%, they seriously threaten Ethereum‚Äôs `credible neutrality`.

Staking provider Lido (as of early 2024) already hovers around the problematic 33% mark.

To guard Ethereum, we need to do our research. Even with `staking pools` we need to make choices that support decentralization.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/network-centralization-again-43bfd55b.svg)

# Knowledge Check 6

True or False: Supporting new node operators helps to decentralize Ethereum.

- [ ] True

> Correct! More node operators means more independent validator nodes detecting fraud.

- [ ] False

> Try again! The more independent nodes, the better.

# rETH - Your Path to Decentralized Staking

It‚Äôs time to become a staker ‚Äî a guardian of Ethereum.
For today‚Äôs quest, we‚Äôre taking ownership of a `staking pool` at Rocket Pool.

ü™ô It‚Äôs simple: Mint or buy Rocket Pool‚Äôs `liquid staking token`, **rETH**.

As the first step on your staking journey, you‚Äôll be funding a `validator node` to process blocks, in exchange for Ether rewards.

**Note:** With rETH, staking rewards are added to the value of the token. If you hold 1 rETH today, you‚Äôll still own 1 rETH in a year. It will just be worth more.

Good luck on your quest, Explorer! May your commitment to Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized future be greatly rewarded.
