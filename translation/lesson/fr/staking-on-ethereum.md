# Staking on Ethereum

Welcome, Explorer, to your next lesson!

Today we will be investigating the process of “staking”, an action you can take today to build digital wealth by volunteering your computer to help secure Ethereum.

`Staking` is like mining on the Bitcoin network: you process transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. But there’s a crucial difference: On Ethereum, you don’t need a powerful computer to compete against others. Instead you lock up `Ether`, Ethereum’s native asset, on the network. In exchange, your computer is granted entry to process transactions and earn rewards.

# Ethereum Wants You!

You can think of `staking` like an “internet bond”.

Just like supporting your government through bonds in exchange for return on investment, you can support Ethereum for staking rewards. And yet just like a government bond, staking is more than an investment opportunity. Your actions have real consequences.

In volunteering your computer to verify transactions, your computer becomes a network `validator node`. Now part of the network itself, your node provides more decentralization and security for everyone using Ethereum. As a `staker`, you become a guardian of Ethereum, and get paid in `Ether`.

It’s time to start your staking journey, dive deeper into staking mechanics, and uncover the simple, low cost staking opportunity to start your journey as a staker — as a guardian of Ethereum — today.

Grab your gear, let’s go.

# Blockchain Security

`Stakers` are the line between a secure and legitimate economy on Ethereum, and one filled with `fraud`.

As a leading blockchain, Ethereum has become a global digital economy where digital assets are traded every day. In a functional economy, it is vital that every transaction is legitimate and no participant has power over others. This fairness is known as `credible neutrality` — and without it an economy spins into fraud, distrust, and eventually collapse. In the blockchain world, fraud often looks like a user manipulating balances or creating non-existent crypto.

For a transaction to be considered valid, it must be approved by a majority of `nodes`. This decentralized agreement is reached using specialised systems called `consensus mechanisms`. Mechanisms change depending on the blockchain, but the goal is always the same: generate decentralized agreement, across the network, on the state of the blockchain.

# Proof of Stake (Pt. I)

On Ethereum, `validator nodes` use a `consensus mechanism` called “Proof-of-Stake” to agree on the legitimacy of blockchain transactions.

Users take a financial position in the game by staking `Ether`, gaining permission to validate the network. Every time a group of transactions are submitted to the network, a node is randomly selected to verify them — with its results double-checked by the others to ensure honesty.

If you successfully process the transactions, your `stake` grows. If you process fraud, your stake is `slashed` — a penalty charge is applied. In this way, your staked Ether is a form of insurance. By this method, everyone is incentivized to act honestly and keep Ethereum running.

To commit fraud on Ethereum, an attacker would need to gain control of a majority of network consensus power: a majority of staked Ether. That’s why staking is so important, it fragments decision making power.

# Proof of Stake (Pt. II)

Let’s look at the step-by-step process of how nodes come to agreement using `Proof-of-Stake` consensus:

1. **Staking:** A staker runs a node on their computer, locking their ETH on the network.
2. **Block Building:** Multiple transactions are bundled into a `block`.
3. **Node Assignment:** The network algorithm selects a node to process a block of transactions.
4. **Block Validation:** The chosen node reviews the block, ensuring its transactions line up with the blockchain `ledger`.
5. **Cross-Verification:** Other nodes double-check and confirm the block’s validity.
6. **Blockchain Addition:** A valid block is added to the Ethereum blockchain.
7. **Rewards:** The staker earns transaction fees and additional Ether rewards.

# Ethernomics

It’s important to understand where the yield for staked `Ether` comes from, and how it can fluctuate based on various ecosystem factors. Simply put, rewards are based on transaction fees, plus a small amount of newly issued Ether.

The resulting yield can look like anything from a 3% to 16% return on investment per year. Where on this spectrum the rewards fall is based on three key factors:

- 📈 **Network Activity:** In times of low traffic, the reward is lower, and in high traffic, higher.
- 👥 **Amount of Stakers:** With more participants, rewards have to be further divided.
- ⚙️ **Staking Method:** How exactly you stake your Ether (and we’ll review our options shortly!)

But before we do, we need to understand that locking Ether to generate yield is just one of it’s core functions. Ether has two other key uses.

# Ether - The “Triple-Point Asset”

In the web3 world, Ether is known as the “triple-point asset”.

In physics, a material’s “triple-point state” is reached when it is engineered to be a solid, liquid, and a gas at the same time. Typically, states of matter are distinct. However, if things are balanced just right, you can enter the triple-point, where all three phases exist at once.

We call Ether the triple-point asset because it has the economic quality of gold, oil, and a bond, all at the same time.

- 🪙 **Digital Gold:** Ether, like Bitcoin, is an easily transferrable store of value.
- 🛢️ **Digital Oil:** Ether is a consumable asset, like oil. People need it to use or build on Ethereum.
- 📜 **Internet Bond:** When staked, Ether becomes a yield-bearing asset, like a government bond.

This is what makes Ether valuable; It fits into all three major frameworks for what a valuable asset should be. On top of this, even when staked and gathering yield, there are many options for keeping staked Ether `liquid`. This way it can be traded, used as collateral for loans, or even `re-staked` for more yield.

Ether isn’t just an internet bond.

Ether is an unprecedented form of money.

# Types of Staking

We’re not going to sugar-coat it: Running a `validator node` on Ethereum requires staking 32 ETH.

That’s a lot of money.

Fortunately, there are easier ways to get involved in staking, and protecting Ethereum. The three key methods are:

- 📡 **Solo Staking:** Running your own validator node.
- ⛲ **Staking Pools:** Joining a group of stakers, running a node together.
- 🏦 **Centralized Exchange Staking:** Joining a crypto business’s node.

Each method requires a different amount of Ether, and technical knowledge to set things up. They also have varied impacts on network decentralization.

# Types of Staking (Pt. 2)

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-b1d559e7.svg)

**Solo Staking**

🟡 Requires 32 ETH

🟡 Technical Setup

🟢 Decentralizes Ethereum

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-ae5bc160.svg)

**Staking Pools**

🟢 Any amount of ETH

🟢 Easy Setup

🟡 Decentralized Options

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/types-of-staking-pt-2-b45b2fba.svg)

**Centralized Exchange Staking**

🟢 Any amount of ETH

🟢 Easy Setup

🔴 Centralizes Ethereum

# Network Centralization

Some staking decentralizes Ethereum, some staking actively centralizes it. What’s that about?

The more validator nodes that are owned by a single entity — a centralized exchange for example — the more power they have to sway `consensus`. If this entity was to gain enough power, they could overpower the network into approving fraudulent transactions, or even denying valid ones. This destroys Ethereum’s core property of `credible neutrality`.

As guardians of Ethereum, we should be looking for the most decentralized staking option available to us. With the barriers of `solo staking` too high for most of us, today we will be investigating the beginner’s option to decentralized staking, `staking pools`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/network-centralization-a29ad576.svg)

# Staking Pools

The best part about `staking pools` is that it’s entirely handled by `smart contracts`. You don’t have to have met the other stakers in person. You don’t even have to trust anyone that you’re running the node with!

Staking pools are coordinated by `staking providers` like Rocket Pool, connecting stakers across the world! In a pool, a `node operator` stakes a portion of Ether and runs the node, everyone else supplies the remaining Ether. For their service, the node operator earns additional yield.

For the participating stakers, their membership to the pool is represented by “Liquid Staking Tokens” (LSTs). These `tokens` are like a share of a pool’s staked ether; The holder earns a portion of rewards equal to their stake, and can trade or redeem them for their stake at any time.

So by simply holding Rocket Pool’s staked Ether token, rETH, you’re earning staking rewards and helping to decentralize Ethereum.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/staking-on-ethereum/staking-pools-0eedad95.svg)

# Network Decentralization — Again!

Now, staking pools themselves have the same catch as the different staking methods: **there are varied degrees of centralization and decentralization.**

While Rocket Pool has taken the steps necessary to allow anyone, anywhere to become a `node operator`, staking providers like Lido, Bedrock, and Stakewise  use a small range of private hosting businesses to run their nodes — centralizing staked Ether!

If any of these platforms gain control over 33% of staked Ether, they could begin causing problems on the network at their decision. If they reach 50%, they could begin threatening Ethereum’s `credible neutrality`.

Today, Lido’s share hovers around the 33% mark.

Guarding Ethereum begins with choosing a decentralized staking provider.

# rETH - Your Path to Decentralized Staking

For today’s quest, we are going to become stakers with Rocket Pool, taking shared ownership over a staking pool. Alongside your fellow Explorers, you will be contributing to the decentralization of Ethereum.

As your Ether holdings grow, you will unlock greater opportunities to decentralize Ethereum and earn rewards. By taking any of these options today, you will complete your quest:

- 🪙 **≥**0.001 ETH: Buy rETH on a `decentralized exchange`.
- 💰 **≥**0.1 ETH: `Mint` new rETH and help run a pool.
- ⛲ **≥**8-16 ETH: Run your own pool as a `node operator`.

Note: rETH is worth slightly more than regular ETH. This is because staking rewards are directly added to the value of the rETH token. By simply holding, your rETH will grow in value against ETH as staking rewards are added to its value.

It’s time to become a guardian of Ethereum. Good luck on your quest, Explorer. May your commitment to Ethereum’s decentralized future be greatly rewarded!
