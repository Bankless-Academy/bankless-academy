# Welcome to Bankless Academy

Welcome, bold Explorer, to the frontier of digital innovation.

At Bankless Academy, our mission is to provide Explorers such as yourself with the best tools and knowledge for “going bankless!”

Using the new era of the internet and `blockchain technology`, we’re unlocking financial freedom and reclaiming ownership of our data and privacy. Which have long been exploited by third parties for profit.

Today, we’re looking at the first event in blockchain history: the invention of `cryptocurrency,` a type of `money` that moves outside of traditional financial systems.

The cryptocurrency boom began with the invention of Bitcoin…

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/welcome-to-bankless-academy-cc6189d4.png)

# Bitcoin’s Story

Launched in 2009 by the mysterious “`Satoshi Nakamoto`,” Bitcoin marked the beginning of a new economic era.

As the first successful `cryptocurrency`, Bitcoin began a powerful conversation: should the control of money continue to rest within traditional banking systems? Or does it belong in the hands of the citizens who earn and use it every day? If you’re unsure of what exactly this means, you’re in the right place!

The reality is that today, we aren’t really in control of our money.

Dive into Bitcoin's journey and how it's reshaping finance by tackling age-old challenges.

**It’s time to rethink money.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/bitcoins-story-98b007a5.png)

# A Brief History of Money

Money has been an integral part of society since our earliest days when beads, shells, and stones were used to exchange goods & services.

Yet early currencies had a problem: it was too easy for someone to find/create new money. The more of something there is, the less value it has, and so everyone’s money would slowly become worth less. If currency was to hold its value, it needed to be harder to find.

Materials like gold & silver were eventually adopted to solve this problem. The key advantage of these materials was their scarcity – there wasn't an endless supply, making it hard for anyone to increase the amount of money in circulation significantly. This `scarcity` helped maintain the value of money.

As societies grew, a government’s central bank would issue standardized coins made of gold & silver. Such currency made money recognizable and measurable while serving as a strong store of value.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/a-brief-history-of-money-b5126abd.svg)

# Knowledge Check 1

True or False:
”As money is added to a monetary system, the existing money becomes worth less.”

- [ ] True

  > Correct! The more money there is, the less value it has.

- [ ] False

  > Try again.

# A Brief History of Money (Pt. 2)

With the introduction of paper money, currencies shifted to being 'backed' by gold. Money’s value was directly linked to a specific amount of the precious metal held in storage.

Then, in the 20th century, came the fall of this “`Gold Standard`”.

Precious metals were slowly disconnected from currencies worldwide — an effort that would allow any country’s economy to grow beyond its supply of gold. As a central bank no longer needed gold to create currency, they could create as much new money as they deemed necessary for their country’s economy. By firmly controlling the money supply, they could also control its value.

Moving into the digital age, electronic currency has vastly replaced physical currency. Storing our money with commercial banks has given us the convenience of credit cards and payment apps. While easy and secure, it also puts for-profit businesses between people and their money.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/a-brief-history-of-money-pt-2-3f9be5ac.svg)

# The Problem

The main problem with our financial system is the lack of control you have over your money. Central banks control the value of money and, therefore, your spending habits. Subject to human error and greed, mistakes can be made. So, we need money that is beyond the control of a single entity and reliably stores its value over time.

Meanwhile, banks can restrict access to your funds and control where and when you can make transactions. This setup can hinder your financial growth and contribute to wider economic inequality and reduced living standards.

***

For money to once again be neutral and reliable, it must regain the two key properties it has lost:

💎 **Value:** Money must reliably store its worth over time.

✊ **Ownership:** Money must be under your complete control. Access to it should be guaranteed and protected.

Only these qualities can return financial freedom & security to modern money.

# Enter Bitcoin

`Satoshi Nakamoto` thought that money was too important to humanity to be controlled by just a few people. He wanted to create a type of money that could be fair and reliable for everyone.

Enter Bitcoin, the digital currency powering global transactions beyond the influence of the traditional banking system.

- ⛓️ Using `blockchain technology`, it connects people directly rather than going through institutions. It’s fast, fully automated, and highly resistant to external pressure.
- 💎 With no central authority to print money, Bitcoin has `scarcity` and value-retention similar to gold.
- ✊ It’s `self-custodial`: It can be held without institutions facilitating transfer or storage. When stored in their natural state, funds are held in a secure online safe to which only the owner has access.

For these qualities, Bitcoin has earned the nickname “digital gold”.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/enter-bitcoin-b108517c.svg)

# Digital Gold: Scarcity

Scarcity in Bitcoin refers to there being a cap on how many Bitcoins can ever exist - which is a maximum of 21 million. This limited supply is designed into its code, ensuring that Bitcoin remains rare and potentially valuable, much like precious metals such as gold.

- Circulating Supply: The Bitcoin that's currently being used or available for trading.
- Total Supply: All the Bitcoin that exists, which is capped at 21 million.

***

Similar to mining gold from the earth, undiscovered Bitcoin is introduced through a laborious process called `cryptocurrency mining`, making it difficult to increase the supply in circulation.

Bitcoin's limited supply makes it valuable and protects it from inflation, unlike traditional currencies,  which can lose value when more is printed. This makes Bitcoin an attractive alternative for those seeking to preserve value in the long term.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/digital-gold-scarcity-eae248f0.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

What quality allows Bitcoin to combat inflation?

- [ ] Its high transaction speed.

  > Incorrect. While speed is a feature, it's not the key factor in preserving value.

- [ ] Its global reach and acceptance.

  > Incorrect. Global reach enhances its usability but doesn't primarily retain its value.

- [ ] Its finite limit of 21 million coins.

  > Correct! Bitcoin's capped supply creates scarcity, similar to precious metals, aiding value retention.

- [ ] Its ability to facilitate online transactions.

  > Incorrect. Online transaction capability is a convenience feature, not directly linked to value retention.

# Digital Gold: Self-Custody

If your bank can freeze your life savings at any time…
**Do you truly own your money?** 💸

As our assets are increasingly digitized (i.e., your money, your property, and even your identity), it’s important that we maintain ownership of our digital footprint. Ownership is a listed human right — something worth remembering as we move into the digital age.

Besides risks of censorship or fraud that come with lack of ownership, instant control over an entire nation’s property is simply too much power to put in one place.

***

Bitcoin’s `self-custody` offers true digital ownership: So long as you don’t give your keys to someone else, you are the only person with access to your assets. It’s like having your own vault of gold in a secure online space, and there’s no management.

This online system gives you total control of your wealth — anywhere in the world, any time.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/digital-gold-self-custody-18bd7ba3.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

How does self-custody support a deeper type of ownership?

- [ ] Resistance to inflation.

> Try again! Inflation and self-custody are unrelated.

- [ ] You can access your assets from anywhere in the world.

> Try again! While this is a quality of self-custody, it doesn’t assure ownership.

- [ ] There’s no third party with control over your assets.

> Correct! When others have control over our assets, there is always possibility for them to be unjustly confiscated.

# Bitcoin — It’s like Emailing Money!

Just as email simplifies sending letters by removing the post office, Bitcoin has streamlined sending money.

- ⚡ Transfer Bitcoin to anyone else’s address in a short period of time, to and from anywhere in the world.
- 📡 Bitcoin is online 24/7. Unlike your bank, you can send money internationally or trade assets at any hour. No waiting, no paperwork, no downtime.
- ⚙️ Bitcoin is neutral and automated. Emails depend on their hosts. Bitcoin runs itself.

***

In the same way that you have an email address, a single Bitcoin address is necessary to receive Bitcoin. You’ll manage your account through a new tool called a `cryptocurrency wallet`, directly in your web browser or on your phone.

This cryptocurrency wallet is the easiest “bank account” you’ll ever set up, all from the comfort of your home computer. We’ll set up your first wallet in ‘Wallet Basics’ — your next lesson.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/bitcoin-its-like-emailing-money-2e2fb8ad.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

How is Bitcoin similar to email?

- [ ] Both are fast, globally accessible, and online 24/7.

> Correct!

- [ ] Both use physical addresses.

> Neither Bitcoin nor email require a physical address. Instead, they use digital addresses.

- [ ] Both are run by the community.

> Email, unlike Bitcoin, is run by private business.

# How does it work?

Let’s switch gears and look at the engine behind Bitcoin: the Bitcoin Network.

Bitcoin runs on a shared network hosted across thousands of computers worldwide. Every computer in the network plays a role in maintaining its operations; the network essentially exists through these computers! If one produces a fraudulent transaction, the others are there to correct it.

This also means there’s no single point to apply pressure in attempted hacks. In order for the network to be attacked, a majority of the computers would need to be compromised.

This defense strategy is called `decentralization`: the shifting of control from one central group to many smaller ones. Decentralization is what makes cryptocurrency transfers virtually unstoppable.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/how-does-it-work-c57acb1b.svg)

# How does it work? (Pt. 2)

When sending cryptocurrency across this network, your transaction is inspected by these `decentralized` network participants. Known as `miners`, these participants constantly check transactions and add them to a database hosted across the network.

This is the `cryptocurrency mining` process. It’s what keeps the network running securely. Mining can get quite complicated, so we’ll take a simplified view for today:

1. You submit a transaction to the network, sending 0.1 `BTC` to your friend.
2. A miner is assigned to check your transaction for errors. Other miners double-check the results.
3. If approved, your transaction is added to the database.
4. Your friend receives 0.1 BTC in their `cryptocurrency wallet`.

Once a transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/how-does-it-work-pt-2-799bae09.svg)

# How does it work? (Pt. 3)

When you send Bitcoin, you pay a fee that rewards the miner who processes your transaction. Miners also earn new Bitcoin, adding to its current circulating supply.

<…>

This is the “mining of undiscovered gold” we mentioned while discussing `scarcity`.

`Cryptocurrency mining` incentivizes people around the world to help secure the network while steadily injecting new currency into the Bitcoin economy.

That’s quite a process!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/what-is-bitcoin/how-does-it-work-pt-3-9b8a77ea.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

What is decentralization?

- [ ] The mining of Bitcoin.

> While mining works alongside decentralization, they are not the same.

- [ ] A process spreading control across multiple parties.

> Correct! And a decentralized network is one where no single entity is in control.

- [ ] Another term for scarcity.

> Decentralization and scarcity are two distinct concepts.

# The Innovation of Money

In this lesson, we’ve looked at how Bitcoin’s scarcity helps it retain value and saw that relying on traditional institutions means not having full asset ownership.

But Bitcoin has become more than just a tool. It was a catalyst for a revolutionary shift towards `decentralized money`, focusing on:

- 💵 Solving inefficiencies in digital economics.
- 🔎 Reducing institutional fraud and market manipulation.
- ⚖️ Building equality of opportunity into money to close the wealth gap.
- 🌐 Building true ownership for the digital age.
- 🤝 A 24/7 global marketplace offers financial tools to unbanked populations worldwide.

This movement highlights Bitcoin’s role in solving key problems in traditional finance by shifting financial control to individuals, promoting transparency, equality, and reduced corruption.

By embodying these principles, it champions the fundamental values of democracy. This guarantees universal access to financial services and true ownership while cultivating a sense of community and shared responsibility among its users.

“_Democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms, and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised.” — United Nations._

# Sending a Bitcoin Transaction

It’s time to simulate your first Bitcoin transaction and practice your freedom in the digital age.

Your transaction will include the following details:

📫 The wallet address of your recipient.

💰 The amount of Bitcoin to send.

⛏️ A transaction fee is given to the miners.

Remember to make sure all details are accurate.
Once a Bitcoin transaction is confirmed, it cannot be reversed.
