# Introduzione al Portafoglio

**Greetings Bankless Explorer!**

It‚Äôs time to dive deeper on your journey into the blockchain multiverse. Every Explorer in this space eventually needs to create a crypto wallet.

Wallets are kind of like the accounts from the `web2` internet that you‚Äôre used to. You‚Äôll use a wallet to log into the blockchain ecosystem, also known as `web3`, where you‚Äôll be able to use `cryptocurrency` and connect to `blockchain apps`!

In this lesson, we‚Äôll introduce you to wallets, how they work, and how to keep your cryptocurrency secure. We‚Äôll¬†end with a guide on how to set one up and access **the Ethereum blockchain ‚Äî the home of Bankless Academy.**

# Definizione di Portafoglio

What exactly is a crypto wallet?

The short definition is: an account on a `blockchain`, used to store digital assets and log into blockchain apps.

It‚Äôs like having your own personal safe on the internet, and you hold the only key for unlocking it. At the same time, this safe is similar to a regular website account. You can use it to make purchases, send or receive `cryptocurrency`, and interact with a blockchain.

However, unlike the `web2` accounts you‚Äôre used to, a single wallet can access an entire blockchain, and a large number of blockchain apps. It‚Äôs like having one account for the entire internet.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-definition-d2912914.svg)

# Creare un portafoglio √® difficile?

It used to be difficult, but these days anyone can create a wallet quite easily.

Se ti senti a tuo agio nello scaricare e installare software sul tuo computer (o app sul tuo telefono), allora non avrai problemi a creare il tuo primo portafoglio.

The trickier part of managing a wallet involves keeping it secure ‚Äî which we‚Äôll dive into shortly!

Choosing your `wallet app` may also feel intimidating. This is the app that you will install on your device to access your wallet on the blockchain. We recommend starting with the Zerion wallet app: it‚Äôs user friendly and has access to many popular blockchains. As you get more comfortable in the `web3` space, you will likely explore other providers and create multiple wallets.

# Knowledge Check 1

Cos'√® un portafoglio?

- [ ] Una blockchain

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Il tuo portafoglio √® ospitato su una blockchain.

- [ ] Una criptovaluta

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Le criptovalute sono qualcosa che tieni nel tuo portafoglio.

- [ ] Un oggetto da collezione digitale

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Gli oggetti da collezione digitali sono qualcosa che tieni all'interno del tuo portafoglio.

- [ ] Un account blockchain

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! Wallets are accounts used to interact with blockchains.

# Portafogli & Recupero della Password

Here is one of the most important things to understand about `web3` wallets: **There are no ‚Äúpassword resets‚Äù or ‚Äúpassword changes‚Äù.**

La maggior parte di noi √® abituata a queste funzionalit√†. If we forget a password, we click a button, do a few things, and get a new password. Facile.

Not so with crypto wallets. Because of how blockchains work, wallets are assigned an ‚Äúaddress‚Äù and a complex ‚Äúpassword‚Äù when they‚Äôre created ‚Äî and you do not choose these.

This address and password combination are impossible to change, although you can always create a new wallet if you need to. Let‚Äôs learn a bit more about these special addresses and passwords, so that we can feel confident using them!

# La chiave pubblica del tuo portafoglio

A `public key` is basically your wallet‚Äôs address. Often, this looks like a random series of letters and numbers.

Esempio: _0xe1887fF140BfA9D3b45D0B2077b7471124acD242_

It is possible to create easier to remember versions of this with some `web3` services, but that‚Äôs a lesson for another time.

You can also think of a public key like a house address. √à pubblica, chiunque pu√≤ vederla, e pu√≤ dire agli altri dove possono inviarti asset cripto ‚Äî senza rivelare nulla di personale su di te.

It is perfectly safe to share your wallet‚Äôs **public key**.

**Note:** A single wallet app can hold multiple public/`private key` pairs.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/your-wallets-public-key-87828c3e.svg)

# La chiave privata del tuo portafoglio

If the public key is like a house address, then the `private key` is like the key to the front door. It‚Äôs the ‚Äúpassword‚Äù to your funds and assets.

Example: _eceac283e04f121cbd40b69e16ab9dec0220df80bf092_

**It‚Äôs never safe to share this key ‚Äî you could lose your wallet and everything in it.**

Most people recommend that you do not even save it digitally. Whoever has access to a private key has access to whatever is in the `wallet`.

This is more than just a password. You cannot reset it if you lose access to it.

Luckily, most `blockchain apps` do not require you to type a long, complicated string of characters every time you need to send funds or sign a blockchain transaction. The private key usually operates quietly in the background.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/your-wallets-private-key-0d84ad39.svg)

# Knowledge Check 2

Your public key is like your _____ and your private key is like your _____ .

- [ ] IBAN / Numero di Conto

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Unlike a bank account number, your private key shouldn‚Äôt be shared with others.

- [ ] Indirizzo / Codice postale

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Unlike a zip code, your private key shouldn‚Äôt be shared with others.

- [ ] House address / House key

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! Your public key allows others to find you, while only your private key lets you in.

- [ ] Numero di Telefono / Numero di Passaporto

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! These are examples of public & private information, but they‚Äôre unrelated.

# Frase di Recupero

When you set up a new wallet, your wallet app will provide you with a `recovery phrase`.

Also called a ‚Äúseed phrase‚Äù or ‚Äúsecret phrase‚Äù, this string of words can be used to access your wallet and crypto assets if:

- Your `wallet app` or device fails unexpectedly or is damaged.
- Your device has been lost or stolen.
- You want to access your wallet on multiple devices.

Most recovery phrases are a list of 12 to 24 words that represent a unique piece of data. This data is used to generate both the `public key` and `private key` for your wallet.

Wallet recovery does **not** change or reset the keys.

Your recovery phrase is essentially an easier to read version of your public/private key pair. **Never share your recovery phrase.**

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/recovery-phrase-c614c36c.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

Can you access your wallet with a recovery phrase if your device gets damaged or lost?

- [ ] No

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova!

- [ ] S√¨

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! Recovery phrases grant access to your wallet, even on multiple devices.

# Tipi di Portafogli

Just as there are many types of computer software, there many types of wallet. Let‚Äôs look at the four main categories:

- üè¶ **Custodial wallets:** where a third party is responsible for your private keys.
- üë§ **Self-custody (non-custodial) wallets:** where you are responsible for your private keys.

There are two styles of `self-custody wallet`:

- üî• **Hot wallets:** software on your desktop or phone.
- üßä **Cold wallets:** a piece of hardware (like a memory stick) you store somewhere safe.

Each wallet solution serves a different use-case. Many advanced users have one of each!

Don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll only be creating one wallet today.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/types-of-wallet-094f0eb1.png)

# Portafogli Custoditi

Since your `private key` unlocks access to your `wallet`, keeping it safe and secure is very important!

`Custodial wallet` services include cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken. **They are your wallet custodian** ‚Äî they look after your private keys for you. You access their services like any other website (with an email login and resettable password).

This may be all some people need, but it requires you to trust these third parties to secure your crypto assets and give you access when you want to trade them or send them somewhere. Also, your access to some `blockchain apps` may be limited.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/custodial-wallets-4eede755.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

Do you control your private key with a custodial wallet?

- [ ] S√¨

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova!

- [ ] No

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! I portafogli custoditi richiedono la fiducia in una terza parte (custode) per il controllo delle chiavi private.

# Portafogli Non-custoditi

A `self-custody wallet` (like Zerion or Trezor) is when you fully control your `private key`. You have **no custodian**, and you alone are responsible for keeping your private key safe.

These wallets offer the widest range of access and freedom within the world of `web3`. You never have to worry about a third party freezing or mishandling your funds.

The trade-off is in risk: if you lose access to your `recovery phrase`, or your private key is compromised, there is often very little you can do to restore access to the wallet.

Whichever route you choose, it pays to be familiar and comfortable with wallet security. We‚Äôll give you some tips before you complete this lesson.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/non-custodial-wallet-833c3d6b.svg)

# Knowledge Check 5

Are you responsible for your private key with a self-custody wallet?

- [ ] S√¨

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! Con un portafoglio in auto-custodia sei l'unico responsabile delle tue chiavi private.

- [ ] No

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova!

# Portafogli Caldi (Hot Wallets)

You will hear the terms ‚Äúhot‚Äù and ‚Äúcold wallet‚Äù quite a bit in `web3`.

A `hot wallet` is a wallet accessed via an app on your device ‚Äî the Zerion app for example. Similar to many `web2` apps, a wallet app is consistently connected to the internet.

Your `private key` is encrypted and stored inside the wallet app, and is only accessed when you interact with the blockchain. These wallets are named ‚Äòhot wallets‚Äô for this ‚Äúhot‚Äù connection between the internet and your private key.

Hot wallets are convenient for small day-to-day interactions, much like a physical wallet you keep in your pocket. We‚Äôll be creating a hot wallet today!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/hot-wallets-9356886d.svg)

# Portafogli Freddi (Cold Wallets)

As you dive deeper into your `web3` journey, you will come to know a landscape full of interesting tech trade-offs.

`Cold wallets` grant higher security at the cost of convenience. A cold wallet is one where your `private key` is stored on a dedicated hardware device (like a memory stick or external hard drive). You must physically connect the hardware wallet to your computer to access your wallet on the blockchain. Your private key is never directly connected to the internet. Cold wallets are named after this ‚Äúcold‚Äù internet connection.

They are widely considered to be more secure than `hot wallets`, because your `private key` is stored offline ‚Äî out of reach of digital attackers.

Ledger and Trezor are examples of `cold wallets`.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/cold-wallets-0e3183d1.svg)

# Knowledge Check 6

Which of the following wallet types is considered the most secure?

- [ ] All wallets are about the same

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! There are various trade-offs for each wallet type, with level of security being one of them.

- [ ] Un portafoglio caldo

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Un portafoglio caldo ha una connessione internet attiva che lo rende pi√π vulnerabile agli attacchi digitali.

- [ ] Un portafoglio custodito

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! La terza parte che detiene le chiavi private pu√≤ essere hackerata o andare in bancarotta.

- [ ] Un portafoglio freddo

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! I portafogli freddi non sono attivamente connessi a Internet, il che li rende pi√π resistenti agli attacchi.

# Sicurezza del Portafoglio

Regardless if your `self-custody wallet` is hot or cold, there are many smart security practices you should develop.

üñäÔ∏è Record your `recovery phrase` on a physical, durable material (such as laminated paper, or even steel) and store it somewhere very safe. Never share it or your `private key` with anyone. **Remember, this is more than just a password.**

üîç When interacting with a blockchain or sending funds, even small amounts, double check the details very carefully. Incorrect details cannot be changed after an interaction.

üî≠ Spend time researching and gathering info on any `blockchain apps` you plan to interact with before connecting your wallet to it or signing its transactions.

üí∞ Use wallets with low amounts of funds to try new things and explore web3, and consider storing high value assets across multiple wallet accounts (i.e. avoid putting all your crypto eggs in one basket).

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/images/wallet-basics/wallet-security-3a185d90.png)

# Knowledge Check 7

What is the safest way to protect your recovery phrase?

- [ ] Scrivila su un materiale durevole e conservala in un luogo sicuro.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! A safely stored physical backup with no digital traces is the safest storage option.

- [ ] Salvala sul tuo computer e stampala.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! If your computer is hacked, your recovery phrase could be found. Anche la stamparla apre molte opportunit√† di attacco.

- [ ] Fai uno screenshot e salvalo sul tuo telefono.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Se il tuo telefono venisse hackerato, potresti perdere tutti i beni contenuti nel tuo portafoglio.

- [ ] Save it in your password manager.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! If your password manager is hacked, your recovery phrase could be leaked.

# Sei pronto a creare il tuo primo portafoglio!

In fact, you‚Äôll need one if you want to claim proof of completing this quest!

There are several `self-custody`, `hot wallet` apps available today. We will explore the Zerion wallet for the rest of this lesson as:

- ‚öôÔ∏è It‚Äôs compatible with most `blockchain apps`.
- ‚ö° The interface is incredibly smooth and easy to use.
- üíª It has a browser extension for Chrome, Brave, Edge, and Opera internet browsers.
- üì± It is also available as a mobile app for Android and iOS users.
- üó£Ô∏è Zerion supports a variety of languages.

The end of the lesson is right around the corner, where we will share your instructions for setting up your wallet with Zerion!

# Knowledge Check 8

Is Zerion a custodial wallet app?

- [ ] S√¨

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Riprova! Your Zerion wallet isn‚Äôt controlled by a custodian.

- [ ] No

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Corretto! Zerion wallets are self-custody wallets ‚Äî controlled by you, and you alone.
