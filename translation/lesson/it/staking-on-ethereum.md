# Staking on Ethereum

Welcome, Explorer, to your next lesson!

Today we will be investigating the process of `staking`, an action you can take today to build digital wealth by volunteering your computer to help secure Ethereum.

Staking is like mining on the Bitcoin network: you process transactions on the blockchain in exchange for rewards. But there’s a crucial difference: On Ethereum, you don’t need a powerful computer to compete against others. Instead, you lock `cryptocurrency` for a set period of time, granting your computer entry to process transactions and earn rewards.

# Ethereum Wants You!

You can think of `staking` like an “internet bond”.

Just like supporting your government through bonds in exchange for return on investment, you can support Ethereum for staking rewards. And yet just like a government bond, staking is more than an investment opportunity. Your actions have real consequences.

In volunteering your computer to verify transactions, you become part of the network itself. You increase the total number of `network validators`, meaning more decentralization and security for the Ethereum community. You become a guardian of Ethereum — and Ethereum wants to reward you for your help.

It’s time to start your staking journey, dive deeper into staking mechanics, and uncover the simple, low cost staking opportunity to start guarding Ethereum today.

Grab your gear, let’s go.

# Blockchain Security

Stakers are the line between a legitimate and secure economy on Ethereum, and one riddled with `fraud`.

As a leading blockchain, Ethereum aims to be a “settlement layer of the internet” — a global economy where digital assets are traded every day. In such an economy, it is vital that every transaction is legitimate and no participant has power over others. We call this `credible neutrality`.

Without this neutrality, an economy spins into fraud, distrust, and eventually destruction. In the blockchain world, fraud often looks like a user manipulating balances or creating non-existent crypto.

To decide which transactions are legitimate, network participants work together using a `consensus mechanism`. Specific methods change depending on the blockchain, but the goal is always the same: generate decentralized agreement, across users, on the state of the blockchain.

# Proof of Stake (Pt. I)

On Ethereum, validators use “Proof of Stake” consensus to come to agreement on the legitimacy of blockchain transactions. Staking helps ensure that only legitimate data and transactions are added to the blockchain.

Users take a financial position in the game by staking Ether, gaining permission to validate the network. Every time a group of transactions are submitted to the network, a validator is randomly selected to verify them — with its results double-checked by the others to ensure it is acting honestly.

If you successfully process the transactions, your `stake` grows. If you process fraud, your stake is `slashed` — a penalty charge is applied. In this way, staked Ether becomes a form of insurance.

By this method, everyone is incentivized to act honestly and keep Ethereum running. To commit fraud on Ethereum, an attacker would need to gain control of a majority of network consensus power: a majority of staked Ether. That’s very expensive and difficult to do.

# Proof of Stake (Pt. II)

Let’s walk through the process step-by-step.

1. **Staking Tokens:** Users lock their ETH in the staking pool.
2. **Validator Selection:** The network’s algorithm randomly selects validators, favouring those with more staked ETH.
3. **Validating Transactions:** The chosen validator reviews the transaction for accuracy.
4. **Building Blocks:** A block builder compiles the transactions into a block.
5. **Cross-Verification:** Other validators double-check the transaction’s validity.
6. **Blockchain Addition:** Once verified, the block joins the Ethereum blockchain.
7. **Rewards:** The validator earns transaction fees and newly minted ETH for their efforts.

# Ether - The “Triple-Point Asset”

Staking Ether is just one of its functions. Before making such an investment, it’s good to understand how else it can be used, and why it’s valuable to hold.

Ether (ETH) is known in the web3 world as the “triple-point asset”. This is because it has the uncommon quality of combining three distinct financial asset properties. Ether is a:

- **Store-of-Value:** ETH preserves value over time, but its also liquid enough to act as money. Like Bitcoin, it’s a digital gold.
- **Consumable Asset:** ETH, when used as gas for transactions or `smart contracts`, behaves like digital oil.
- **Capital Asset:** When staked to back network security, ETH becomes a yield-bearing asset, functioning as an “internet bond”.

The triple-point asset metaphor is based on a principle from physics. Phases of matter are usually distinct; something is either a solid, liquid, or gas. However, if things are balanced just right, you can enter the triple-point, where all three phases exist all at once.

This is what makes Ether valuable as internet money. It fits into all three major frameworks for what a valuable asset should be. On top of this, the triple-point state remains liquid enough to be used as a financial instrument across the world of decentralized finance. Even when staked, Ether can be traded or used as collateral for loans.

It’s a financial asset with a lot of firepower.

# Ethernomics

It’s important to understand where the yield for staked Ether comes from, and how it can fluctuate based on various ecosystem factors. Simply put, rewards are based on transaction fees, plus a small amount of newly issued Ether.

The resulting yield can look like anything from a 3% to 16% return on investment per year. Where on this spectrum the rewards fall is based on two key factors:

- **Network Activity:** In times of low traffic, the reward is lower, and in high traffic, higher.
- **Amount of Stakers:** With more participants, rewards have to be further divided.

There’s also a minor modifier added on top, which is the method of staking you use. More direct methods give higher yield, but come with more responsibility and commitment.

# Types of Staking

Different staking methods exist because users have varying amounts of tokens, technical skills, and risk preferences. Here are the four methods available, each tailored to different user needs and capabilities:

1. **Solo Home Staking:** The direct method, running your own validator node from home. This method suits those with 32 ETH and technical skills. No third parties. It adds a new node to Ethereum and earns full rewards.
2. **Staking as a Service:** A service manages your node, without requiring your private keys. Ideal for users with 32 ETH but less technical inclination. Requires trust of a third party, and payment for the service.
3. **Pooled Staking:** Collective staking and reward sharing. Using smart contracts, you contribute a portion of 32 Ether to help fund a node. Perfect for those with smaller ETH holdings, seeking a simple staking solution.
4. **Centralized Exchanges:** Staking through a “crypto-bank”. The exchange runs the nodes, and shares rewards with its stakers. A beginner-friendly option that requires trust in the platform.

Choosing the right staking method means finding alignment with your resources and expertise. Many people begin their staking journey with the more accessible options, and work towards solo home staking as they grow their ETH holdings.

# Centralization Risks

While inspecting PoS consensus, we looked at how maintaining decentralization of nodes is crucial for maintaining `credible neutrality`. Consensus works by majority, so if one participant captures a majority of staked Ether, they gain the ability to sway decisions on what transactions are legitimate and which are fraud. In this way, preserving decentralization on Ethereum becomes paramount.

Because granting our Ether to centralized staking pools or exchanges creates concentration of stake under one entity, use of certain staking methods can actually centralize Ethereum. If a single entity accumulates too much staked Ether, they can begin to make undesired changes to the network.

- **33% Control:** Holding one-third of the staked ETH can disrupt or halt the network.
- **50% Control:** This level of control can lead to significant network issues.
- **66% Control:** Also known as 'god mode,' it allows for total dominance over the network.

Bankless Explorers seeking to stand for the neutrality of Ethereum should choose decentralized staking solutions, where yields can be just as high as centralized options.

# Liquid Staking Tokens

There is a fifth option for staking that we haven’t yet discussed.

Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) are indicators of where reward should be distributed, given to members who have contributed Ether to Staking Pools. By purchasing staking tokens from these participants, you take their share of a staking pool and earn its entitled rewards. LSTs provide an easy route into Ethereum staking, especially for those with smaller ETH holdings.

As with any token, not all LSTs are created equal. If a platform doesn’t take sufficient steps to decentralize their nodes, they can actually end up centralizing Ethereum because they are pooling lots of staked Ether under one provider.

- validator diversity
- node decentralization

Rocket Pool for example, has sufficiently decentralized their infrastructure …

On the other hand, Lido has …

# rETH - Your Path to Decentralized Staking

For today’s quest, we are going to take partial ownership of a Rocket Pool staking pool. Alongside your fellow Explorers, you will be contributing to the decentralization of Ethereum, driving up demand for use of decentralized LSTs and earning rewards.

As your Ether holdings grow, you can contribute to Rocket Pool with increasing impact:

- > 0.1 ETH: `Mint` new rETH
- > 8-16 ETH: Run an rETH Minipool

Taking any of these options will serve as completion for today’s quest.

Rocket Pool distinguishes itself by enabling a progression from passive staking, to becoming an active mini-pool operator where others can gather. This pathway contrasts starkly with centralized LSTs, offering clear path of progression along an involved role in Ethereum's ecosystem.

rETH is more than staking. It's a commitment to Ethereum's decentralized future, and the beginning of a journey to grow your impact in exchange for increasing rewards.
