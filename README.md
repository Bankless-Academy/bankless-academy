## How to import content from Notion

### Where to update the content

[https://banklessacademy.notion.site/129141602de240e484356bd85f7c75e0](https://banklessacademy.notion.site/129141602de240e484356bd85f7c75e0)

### Default content import command

```bash
yarn import-content -h
```

### Import content with a specific Notion ID

### How does it work

The [import script](https://github.com/bankless-academy/bankless-academy/blob/main/import-content.js) connects to a custom unofficial Notion API called Potion [https://github.com/bankless-academy/potion](https://github.com/bankless-academy/potion) and transforms the content into [this Object](https://github.com/bankless-academy/bankless-academy/blob/main/src/constants/lessons.ts).
