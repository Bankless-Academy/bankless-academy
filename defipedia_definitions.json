  "#dev DeFi": "An aggregate lending and borrowing protocol. The protocol is fully decentralized and open-source on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). Under markets, in each asset, there are multiple vaults for users to choose from. Vaults have different risks and rewards. Users can choose to lend their assets to any vault based on their preferences. Genesis vaults are vaults in which assets are not deposited to any other platforms or smart contracts. The main reason is that assets deposited to other platforms are subject to risks and changes of the other platforms. The downside of the Genesis vault is its probably low APY; however, Genesis offers low transaction fees and safety of capital. To borrow, users first need to deposit/lend their assets to #dev DeFi. After deposit, users can enable an asset as collateral. Collateral is used to protect lenders' principal in case of liquidation. Once users have collateral in #dev DeFi, they can borrow assets at Borrowing Interest Rates. By default, #dev DeFi will help users to borrow their desired assets at the lowest interest rates possible. This means that the assets will come from vaults that have lowest borrowing APR and thus lowest lending APY.\n",

  "88mph": "A decentralized protocol that acts as a yield optimizer for liquidity providers. Liquidity pools in 88mph collect deposited base assets from liquidity providers and deploy them onto lending platforms to earn interest. However, unlike other yield aggregators, 88mph aims to differentiate itself through the introduction of floating-rate bonds.\n\nOne of the biggest issues that yield farming pools face is the effects of impermanent loss. Liquidity providers may lose out on value when the market price of their deposited assets is lower than when it was initially deposited. Through floating-rate bonds, 88mph aims to provide better exposure to yield farmers by providing a complementary financial product that mitigates the associated risks of pooling deposits.\n\n88mph acts as an intermediary between liquidity providers and lending protocols. Through adaptors, the 88mph protocol will automatically deploy its liquidity pools to the highest-yielding lending protocol at a given interval. Liquidity providers may supply 88mph’s liquidity pools at any given time which have to be locked for at least 7 days. Assets may be staked for up to a year. \n\nHowever, because 88mph employs a floating interest rate, if the floating interest rate’s APY drops to a very low value and stays there for a long period, deposits made when the floating interest rate’s APY were still high would be unable to generate sufficient interest to cover the original interest payouts. \n\nIn order to mitigate the risk of insolvency, 88mph also offers floating-rate bonds which immediately fills up the debt of one or more of the deposits. In return, the bond-purchaser would receive the yield generated by those deposits. At the time of writing, the yield received by bond-purchasers are 75% of the initial floating interest rate APY. \n\nThe idea behind this system is that floating-rate bonds effectively doubles up as both a risk mitigation tool for liquidity providers, and operates as a financial product which allows users to long the interest rates of lending protocols.\n",
  "88mph Token": "MPH tokens are primarily used as a utility token to gain access to the 88mph rewards pool. By staking MPH tokens, users are able to earn protocol fees and yield-farming rewards (e.g. yield-farmed tokens from linked protocols such as Compound). However, it should be noted that in order to withdraw a deposit, the user will have to pay back a certain amount of MPH tokens (depending on the pool, 30-90% of the initial MPH reward would need to be paid back in order to withdraw).\n",
  "401k plan": "In the US, a 401k is an employer-sponsored, government-supported pension savings plan for employees. 401k plans allow companies to sponsor eligible employees in saving and investing towards retirement by contributing a portion of their income to the plan on a tax-deferred basis.

Apart from this, AAVE can be staked within the protocol Safety Module to provide security/insurance to the protocol/depositors and that way earn staking rewards and fees from the protocol.\n",
  "Aavegotchi": "A Non-Fungible Token (NFT) collectible with DeFi (Decentralized Finance) enabled elements released on Ethereum in late 2020. Aavegotchi is built around DeFi token collateral stakes, dynamic rarity, rarity farming, DAO-governed game mechanics, and a playable metaverse with mini-games. They are rare crypto-collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain, backed by the ERC-721 standard used in popular blockchain games such as CryptoKitties, Axie Infinity, and Cryptovoxels. Aavegotchis possess three attributes that determine their overall value and rarity within the Aavegotchi universe, collateral stake, traits, and wearables. Each Aavegotchi ERC721 NFT manages an escrow contract address that holds an Aave-backed ERC20 collateral, or “aToken”. aTokens generate yield via Aave’s LendingPool, which increases the quantity of aTokens held in the wallet. Thus, the amount of aTokens held in the Aavegotchi’s escrow address grows over time. Aavegotchis possess multiple traits that influence their rarity, their performance in mini-games, and the wearables they can equip. Some are generated randomly upon birth, and others depend on user interactions with the Aavegotchi. Upon birth, every Aavegotchi is assigned several random trait values using the ChainLink VRF random number generator. Trait values are distributed on a bell-curve, and each trait is assigned a value of Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, or Mythical, depending on its rarity. \"Kinship\" is not randomly assigned, but rather starts at a fixed value upon birth and increases or decreases based on various factors, such as how long the Aavegotchi has been with the same owner, and how often the owner interacts with it. Aavegotchis level up as they gain more experience by voting in AavegotchiDAO and participating in mini-games. Every few levels, Aavegotchis receive one Spirit Point that can be allocated towards increasing or decreasing a certain trait. In addition to managing the aToken escrow, Aavegotchis also extend the ERC998 Composables standard, which allows them to manage child NFTs, known as wearables in the Aavegotchi ecosystem. Not every wearable can be equipped by every Aavegotchi. Some wearables may be exclusively equipped by Aavegotchis staked with certain collaterals, those of a certain level, and those with certain traits. Some wearables can increase or decrease certain traits of an Aavegotchi. For example, equipping a sword may slightly boost an Aavegotchi’s aggressiveness, whereas equipping a Bob Marley shirt may decrease its energy level.\n",
  "Aavegotchi Portals": "NFTs that could be opened to summon an Aavegotchi. Portals could be acquired from the official Aavegotchi DApp or on secondary marketplaces such as the Baazaar. Upon opening the portal, the Chainlink Verifiable Random Function (VRF) is called to randomly generate the traits of the Aavegotchis inside the portal. After opening a portal, gamers are presented with 10 Aavegotchis. They have to select 1 out of the 10 Aavegotchis to summon from the opened portal. The remaining 9, unfortunately, will vanish. There is no time limit for selecting an Aavegotchi.\n",
  "AavegotchiDAO": "The DAO managing Aavegotchi. It has three phases (and one intermediate phase): (1) Genesis, (2) Cocoon, (3) Metamorphosis, and (4) Oasis. \n\nGenesis is the first iteration of AavegotchiDAO that was launched in tandem with the GHST token distribution event. GHST token holders had the power to vote on increasing / maintaining the funds distributed by the tap mechanism of the token bonding curve (TBC) reserve to Pixelcraft Studios (the team behind Aavegotchi) to support development. This initial proposal of raising the tap from 50,000 DAI to 100,000 DAI per month passed with 99% approval on 18 October 2020.\n\nCocoon is V1.5 of AavegotchiDAO. The intermediate point between Genesis and Metamorphosis. The priority for the Cocoon stage is to influence game mechanics.\n\nMetamorphosis is the second iteration of AavegotchiDAO, and is charged with managing simple game mechanics of Aavegotchi, such as the total supply of Aavegotchis, adding new collaterals, deciding on their functions, and adding new wearables created by the community.\n\nOasis is the final iteration of AavegotchiDAO's evolution.

  "Aavenomics": "A formalized path to the decentralization and autonomy of the Aave Protocol. Acting as a catalyst for growth, Aavenomics introduces a future-proof framework leveraging financial incentives and multilevel governance to prioritize the safety and sustainability of Aave. Formal documentation detailing the specific inner workings of the topics covered in this paper can be found in the Aavenomics paper. The migration to AAVE marks the first step in transitioning governance power from the Aave core team to AAVE token holders. LEND will migrate to AAVE at a rate of 100 LEND per 1 AAVE, with the supply changing from 1.3B LEND to 16M AAVE. Of the 16M AAVE being issued, 13M AAVE tokens will be redeemed by LEND holders and 3M AAVE tokens will be held in an Aave Ecosystem Reserve for protocol incentives. The Aave Protocol will be able to distribute Ecosystem Incentives (EI) for supplying and borrowing assets from the protocol. The community may also decide to allocate rewards to applications built on top of the Aave ecosystem. The decision to integrate new incentives will be performed through decentralized governance. Aave will be secured by a Safety Module (SM), a staking mechanism for AAVE tokens to act as insurance against Shortfall Events. Stakers earn AAVE as Safety Incentives (SI) along with a percentage of protocol fees. Staking will feature plain AAVE alongside an AAVE/ETH pair. The latter will leverage Balancer to incentivize market liquidity and earn BAL along with trading fees. Staked AAVE will be freely tradable after a cooldown period. All rewards accrue in real-time and are distributed as AAVE is withdrawn or transferred from the Safety Module. The Aave Ecosystem Reserve will act as a bootstrap fund allocated to protocol incentives as governance sees fit. AAVE holders will determine how the Ecosystem Reserve will be allocated between Safety and Ecosystem Incentives.\n",

  "ACA Token": "The native token of ACALA Network. The total supply of the ACA Tokens will be minted at the launch of the mainnet and stored in the ACA Reserve Pool to be distributed to ACALA Foundation, Seed Investment Partners, IPO Participants as Reward, and the rest sold to the public.\n\nACAs serve three key functions in ACALA Network:\n\n Network Utility Token: ACA tokens are used for paying network transaction fees, stability fees (interest rate of the aUSD loan), and penalty fees in case of liquidation.\n\nTo close any CDP that has been created to generate aUSDs in the ACALA Network, some ACA tokens are required to be paid as the Stability Fee. Unique to the ACALA Network, an equivalent amount of aUSDs or other supported assets can be accepted as payment of fees, which can be automatically exchanged to ACA via the built-in exchange. When ACA is received, it is burned and removed from the supply permanently. As market demand for aUSDs and CDPs increases, demand for ACA increases as users needs them to pay the Stability Fee.\n\nAll active CDPs are constantly monitored by the system, and for each type of collateral, ACA holders would vote for a liquidation ratio - the mininum collateral-to-debt ratio required to avoid liquidation of an open CDP. Once the collateral-to-debt ratio has fallen below the liquidation ratio, then the CDP becomes risky. The CDP will then be automatically liquidated by the system in a Collateral Auction mechanism where a liquidation penalty paid in aUSD will be deducted from the collateral sales. The liquidation penalty will be automatically used to purchase ACA tokens in an exchange by the system, which will be burnt and permanently removed from the ACA supply.\n\n Governance of the Network: As a governance token, ACA token holders have rights to propose network upgrades, and risk parameter adjustments (such as Stability fee, Debt Ceiling, Liquidation Ratio, and Liquidation Penalty), which will be approved or declined by the elected on-chain General Council.\n\n Contingency Solution: In situations such as a sudden price collapse of a collateral asset resulting in under-collateralized CDPs, ACA tokens will be automatically diluted and sold on the market for system recapitalization.\n",

  "Account": "An entity on the Blockchain. There are currently 3 account types: Externally Owned Account(Private key control), Contracts(code controlled), and Contract Wallets(Multisig).\n",
  "Account Abstraction Layer": "The technical infrastructure that makes smart contract development possible on the Qtum blockchain. The foundational layer of Qtum follows the UTXO model used on blockchains such as Bitcoin. The Account Abstraction Layer (AAL) on Qtum allows the accounts model used on Ethereum to be “abstracted” or transferred in order to work on top of the UTXO model. Qtum’s AAL is the computing go-between that allows the UTXO and accounts models to interact.\n",
  "Account Model": "A blockchain architecture that features direct information and value transfer. Smart contract platforms such as Ethereum use the account model as opposed to the UTXO model used by the Bitcoin network, which limits the capabilities of smart contracts. One potential downside of the account model architecture is difficulty in scaling transactions-per-second.\n",
  "Account-Based Chains": "Blockchains (such as the Ethereum and EOS blockchains) that represent coins as balances within an account. Accounts can be controlled by a private key, or by a smart contract - and account-based models are mostly popular among smart contract-focused blockchains. Account-based models are simpler than UTXO models; they can be treated as similar to bank accounts, which represent user balances within a single account and allow for deposits and withdrawals in and out of that account. Under the account-based model, unlike with UTXOs, balances can be partially spent. For example, if a user has 10 ETH, they can send someone 3.75 ETH directly from their account, and the result of this transaction is that they now have 6.25 ETH and the other person has 3.75 ETH. They don't have to send the full 10 ETH and then receive 6.25 ETH in change, as they would on a UTXO chain.\n",
  "Account-checker Tool": "A script or program that takes a list of usernames and passwords — known as a combolist — and tests them against a set of target websites. Account-checker tools substantially increase the speed and efficiency with which an attacker can test a large volume of credentials on a broad range of websites and service providers. These tools are generally used by malicious actors looking to capitalize and commit fraud or identity theft against the account holders from whom they have stolen access.\n",
  "Accumulation": "In general, accumulation is to collect or increase the amount of something. In finance, accumulation can refer more narrowly to increases in the position size of an asset that is built up over multiple transactions. Accumulation can also refer to the overall addition of positions to a portfolio.\n\nIn technical analysis, accumulation points to a general increase in buying activity in an asset. In this case, the asset is said to be \"under accumulation\" or \"being accumulated.\"\n\nDeferred annuities have an accumulation phase in the first years of the contract where savers contribute funds. The accumulation phase is then followed by the distribution phase, in which retirees begin accessing and using their funds.\n",
  "Accumulation/Distribution Indicator": "A cumulative indicator that uses volume and price to assess whether a stock is being accumulated or distributed. The A/D measure seeks to identify divergences between the stock price and volume flow. This provides insight into how strong a trend is. If the price is rising but the indicator is falling it suggests that buying or accumulation volume may not be enough to support the price rise and a price decline could be forthcoming.\n\nThe A/D indicator is cumulative, meaning one period's value is added or subtracted from the last. In general, a rising A/D line helps confirm a rising price trend, while a falling A/D line helps confirm a price downtrend. The A/D line helps to show how supply and demand factors are influencing price. A/D can move in the same direction as price changes or it may move in the opposite direction.\n",
  "ACO": "A decentralized non-custodial options protocol built on top of Ethereum that allows users to trade, mint and exercise call or put options, in a trustless and decentralized manner without having to rely on any third party.

Active managers may rely on investment analysis, research, and forecasts as well as their own judgment and experience in making decisions on which assets to buy and sell.\n",
  "ACTUS Protocol": "A smart contract system for issuing and servicing financial assets on Ethereum. ACTUS Protocol is based on an open-source implementation of the ACTUS standard in Solidity. It allows to issue, progress and tokenize ACTUS compliant assets on Ethereum. All assets have a unified term sheet and a clear and well-defined schedule. External data, such as changing interest rates are supported through external market objects which can be connected to oracles. Assets can have credit enhancements such as on-chain collateral or legal guarantees. ACTUS assets are registered in an asset registry. They are progressed through their lifecycle according to their schedule. An Asset's schedule, which is the basis for the protocol's state machine, is derived from its terms using the solidity implementation of ACTUS, guaranteeing a common understanding about who owes what to whom and when.\n",
  "Acumen Protocol": "An autonomous, non-custodial interest rate protocol native to the Solana blockchain that uses algorithmically set interest rates to enable open financial applications. Acumen facilitates seamless interest-earning by establishing decentralized money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically set interest rates based on the supply and demand of loanable funds. Acumen engenders the ability to earn interest on your SPL tokens by connecting suppliers and borrowers of assets together. The Acumen protocol is inspired by Compound and Aave. Interest rate models and the architecture have been modeled off these protocols.\n",
  "Acumen Token": "Governance token of Acumen protocol. There is a total of 19,000,000 Acumen tokens (ACMN). The Distribution of ACMN is as follows:\n\n 8,867,409 ACMN has been allocated to protocol users \n 5,816,700 ACMN has been distributed to developers who created the protocol\n 3,266,700 ACMN has been allocated for liquidity and ecosystem advancement\n 750,636 ACMN has been allocated for future developers\n 298,555 ACMN has been allocated for Governance\n 0 ACMN has been sold or retained by Acumen\n",
  "Adamant Finance": "A yield optimizer vault that consists of many farmers pooling their time and resources to collectively earn the best DeFi yields.

Users deposit Quickswap LP tokens to Adamant's vault contracts, which are then compounded into more LP tokens or staked for more QUICK. Utilizing the power of exponential compound interest allows Adamant's vaults to earn much higher yields compared to normal staking. Users also avoid gas fees and save time.\n",
  "Address": "A string of characters that represents a wallet that can send and receive cryptocurrency. It is akin to a real-life address, email or website. Every address is unique and denotes the location of a wallet on the blockchain. Most blockchain addresses are difficult for humans to read, as they take the form of long random strings of letters and numbers. However, they are all unique, which poses no problems for computer networks. Blockchain addresses are public and you can utilize a blockchain explorer to see the transactions in and out of an address. You can also see the amount of assets that the address has. The only exception are the privacy-based blockchains (eg. Monero and Grin). Even though the addresses are public, most of the addresses are anonymous (or rather, pseudonymous) as the person owning the address does not usually have their real name associated with it. However, there are cases where addresses and the person or entity behind them is known: this is usually the case for exchanges and token project owners or founders.\n",
  "ADDY Token": "The native token of Adamant Finance and provides value for liquidity providers and token stakers.\n\nADDY borrows aspects from the tokenomics of two of the leading DeFi platforms on Binance Smart Chain: Pancake Bunny and Ellipsis, which have a combined $10b TVL.\n \nADDY has an emission system similar to Bunny's, where for every 1 BNB earned in performance fees, 5 BUNNY were minted. In ADDY's case, 475 ADDY are minted for every 1 ETH earned in performance fees. Because ADDY emissions are based on the profit generated through performance fees, that means excess supply won't flood the market during periods of low revenue (i.e. bear markets).\n\nThe ADDY token does not have a maximum supply, like BUNNY.\n \nUsers can earn ADDY by using the vaults or buy it on Quickswap. Roughly 13% of all ADDY minted goes towards development to ensure rapid innovation.\n",

  "Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio": "Many Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) created do not represent a sale or purchase of a given coin (these include relay transactions and change). However, the original Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) metric treats these as sale/purchase transactions between parties, adding noise to the metric. As such, adjusted SOPR (aSOPR) filters out all UTXOs with a lifespan of less than an hour and thereby eliminates obvious relay transactions. In turn, this provides a more accurate signal of actual sale/purchase transactions. Adjusted SOPR uses the same formula as SOPR, but simply filters out any UTXOs which are less than an hour old. Created by Renato Shirakashi.\n",
  "Admin Key Risk": "When control over a DeFi protocol or product is held by the protocol/product team, there is a risk of the team siphoning funds away using their Admin Key.\n",
  "Affinity Bias": "A type of bias that is defined as a person’s general tendency to make irrational, potentially uneconomical, choices. The bias specifically references actions taken based on an individual’s belief that that decision (whether for a product or service) will reflect their values or how others perceive them. A common example is buying an Apple iPhone as that gives off the perception of being technologically on the cutting edge and a bit more upmarket. This, despite the fact that some iPhone’s may be rated lower than other phones and in fact cost more for this lower rated performance. The power of “brand” is implanting this perception of technological luxury to lead to a real outcome, i.e. a consumer making a potentially irrational choice to buy an iPhone over an alternative. That’s not to say that an iPhone is a bad phone or that the value of “feeling” good about the purchase and fitting in to a social norm doesn’t have worth. But it is to say that if one could be blind to brand the rational calculus would be to go with a cheaper, better-performing alternative.\n",

  "Airdrop": "A method of distributing cryptocurrency to the public, via the fact that they own certain other tokens or wallets on a particular blockchain. This is usually done for marketing purposes to incentivize the holding of other tokens or induce them to become a participant in the blockchain network. Airdrops usually work by requiring users to hold a certain amount of tokens in a publicly discoverable wallet at a predetermined time (snapshot time). The token project conducting the airdrop would then use the snapshot to distribute the airdrop tokens accordingly. The effect of airdrops allow users to diversify their cryptocurrency holdings, spread awareness of the airdropped token and earn an effective dividend (of their previous holdings). Most airdrop campaigns run with mechanics such as receiving coins or tokens in exchange for simple tasks like sharing news, referring friends or downloading an app.\n",

Everyone uses algorithms in their daily lives, most of the time without even realizing it. However, the term is most commonly used in the areas of computing, as machines generally require strict rules to follow. In computing, algorithms need to be unambiguous and logically precise. Machines are programmed to perform tasks linearly and the logic that drives them needs to be designed as such. Good algorithms perform tasks quickly and accurately, utilizing as few resources as possible.\n",
  "Algorithmic Stablecoin": "Algorithmic stablecoins do not use fiat or cryptocurrency as collateral.

  "Allocation": "An allotment of tokens or equity, that may be earned, purchased, or set aside for a certain investor, team, group, organization, or other related entity. For a crypto team in its whitepaper stages, the executive team or community may work on deciding what allocations of tokens should be divided up into different initiatives and departments, such as development, marketing, operational costs, and so on. If a team has a foundation or other entity that is in control of funds, it may also decide to create an allocation for a token treasury to be utilized as specified by the team or community. Investors can also receive allocations in rounds of investments. For example, a team may sell allocations of a set \"ticket size\", or maximum amount, to early investors in a private sale round. In this case, each of these individual investing parties would own an allocation out of the total amount offered on that particular round of sale. An individual entity may have the potential to hold allocations from multiple rounds of sale, which means they could eventually participate in different stages of an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) or token sale event, with a predefined allocation for each stage. Team members working on a specific coin, protocol, or project may also receive part of a team allocation as a reward for their work. For instance, these allocations could be paid out all at once at a certain date - such as the date of a token generation event (TGE) - or spread out over time, following a predefined schedule. In certain situations, the allocations are distributed over time as part of a block reward or over a vesting period or cliff.\n",

In fact, upon launch of leveraged yield farming, there will already be several mechanisms in place making ALPACA deflationary in nature.\n\nAccrue Value Through Deflation: Every time their liquidation bot liquidates a leveraged position, it receives 5% of the position's value as a fee. 100% of those fees will go towards buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token. When a borrower takes out a loan of tokens in order to engage in leveraged farming, they pay a fee to the lender in interest. 10% of that interest will go towards the protocol fee, of which half (5%) will be used on buybacks and burns of the ALPACA token.\n\nALPACA tokens will be a fundamental part of future initiatives providing protocol utility. In particular, they are planning an NFT integration that will require ALPACA tokens to participate, and will offer benefits relating to various aspects of leveraged yield farming such as higher available leverage level, higher lending rates for lenders, lower lending rates for borrowers, and more.\n",
  "Alpha": "A term used in investing to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its \"edge.\" Alpha is thus also often referred to as \"excess return\" or \"abnormal rate of return,\" which refers to the idea that markets are efficient, and so there is no way to systematically earn returns that exceed the broad market as a whole. Alpha is often used in conjunction with beta (the Greek letter β), which measures the broad market's overall volatility or risk, known as systematic market risk.\n\nAlpha is used in finance as a measure of performance, indicating when a strategy, trader, or portfolio manager has managed to beat the market return over some period. Alpha, often considered the active return on an investment, gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark that is considered to represent the market's movement as a whole. The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index is the investment's alpha. Alpha may be positive or negative and is the result of active investing. Beta, on the other hand, can be earned through passive index investing.\n",

  "American Options": "A version of an options contract that allows holders to exercise the option rights at any time before and including the day of expiration. Another version or style of option execution is the European option that allows execution only on the day of expiration. An American-style option allows investors to capture profit as soon as the stock price moves favorably. The names American and European have nothing to do with the geographic location but only apply to the style of rights execution.\n\nAmerican options outline the timeframe when the option holder can exercise their option contract rights. These rights allow the holder to buy or sell—depending on if the option is a call or put—the underlying asset, at the set strike price on or before the predetermined expiration date. Since investors have the freedom to exercise their options at any point during the life of the contract, American-style options are more valuable than the limited European options. However, the ability to exercise early carries an added premium or cost.\n\nThe last day to exercise a weekly American option is normally on the Friday of the week in which the option contract expires. Conversely, the last day to exercise a monthly American option is normally the third Friday of the month.\n\nThe majority of exchange-traded options on single stocks are American, while options on indexes tend to be European style.\n",
  "AMO": "A secure platform for automotive data exchange and valuation, designed to fuel innovation and benefit-sharing in the transportation industry. Participants in the AMO Market are all stakeholders within the automobile industry be it car users, automobile manufacturers, or automotive service providers. They participate in AMO Market simultaneously as data producers and consumers in a cycle of value sharing and creation. A technology-enabled economic system, AMO Market is built on the AMO Blockchain and supports the fair valuation of data and distribution of rewards. Accounting for adjustments in supply and demand, payouts and purchases are made with AMO Coin. Car data is no longer limited to narrow use by a select few, but with express consent of data owners becomes a shared asset that benefits other participants in the AMO Market. When service providers or manufacturers want to access car user data, proper authorization is brokered with data owners, and even then all information and sensitive data is protected using cryptography. \n",
  "AMO Coin": "Native token of AMO. The car data that car users have agreed to share is stored on the AMO Blockchain in exchange for AMO Coin according to the value of the data provided. Using these AMO Coins, car users are able to purchase various products and services offered by manufacturers and service providers participating in AMO Market. Data producers can share data and receive compensation in AMO Coins according to the evaluated value of the data. Data consumers can obtain the rights to extract and use the data by paying that evaluated value in AMO Coins. Service providers, manufacturers, and maintenance companies can in turn also submit secondary processed data in the AMO blockchain and receive AMO Coins, according to the value of that data.\n",
  "Ampleforth": "A cryptocurrency with a supply that changes daily. The AMPL protocol automatically adjusts supply in response to demand. When price is high, wallet balances increase. When price is low, wallet balances decrease. AMPL is non-dilutive. Supply adjustments are applied universally and proportionally across every wallet’s balance. This means your percent ownership of the network remains fixed. Today's cryptocurrenices are dangerously correlated. AMPL's unique incentives allow it to decouple from Bitcoin's price pattern. This reduces systematic risk by adding diversity to a homogeneous ecosystem. Like precious metals, today's fixed supply cryptocurrencies are vulnerable to sudden shocks in demand and cannot be used to denominate complex contracts. As a result, sophisticated economies cannot be built upon them. AMPL is the simplest direct solution to the supply inelasticity problem. Uses cases include: (1) A diversifying Asset, (2) A DeFi Building Block, and (3) A Better Bitcoin.\n",
  "Ampleforth Geysers": "Product of Ampleforth. Ampleforth Geysers are smart faucets that incentivize on-chain liquidity. Users receive AMPL for providing liquidity on automated market making platforms (AMMs) like uniswap.

  "Amy Finance": "A Layer2 based DeFi aggregator that supports margin trading and lending. They are a fair launch project without presale and private investor. It's a community-driven project helping users to earn safe and high yields.\n\nThe reason they build Amy Finance in the first place is to truly reduce risks for users and improve user experience. They will realize it through designing better lending protocol deployed on Layer 2.\n\nCapital efficiency has always been a problem faced by all DeFi players, but very few teams manage to solve it through the underlying design. Assembly Pool offers one solution: one pool for multiple usages. With this, lenders can enjoy diversified benefits with very low arbitrage risk. The several mainstream leveraged lending protocols on the market are constrained by impermanent loss, but in Amy's ecosystem, capital utilization rate can be increased without leveraging.\n\nRecently, the problems of flash loans are looming large. Many problems have occurred because of poor protocol design and false risk assessment. They believe that the improvement of capital utilization rate should not be accomplished at the expense of capital security. In an environment where asset price fluctuate in seconds, they believe that users with different risk preferences can hedge against risks for each other and therefore establish a balanced ecosystem.\n",
  "AMY Token": "Native token of Amy Finance. AMY token has the following four features:\n\n Incentives for early adopters.\n Use protocol fees to buyback and burn $AMY.\n Stake $AMY token to earn $AMY rewards(Newly minted $AMY token and procotol fees). \n Used as fee to assemble higher level Golden Cats.\n\nIn $AMY token economics, $AMY has a hard cap of 1,000,000,000, and there's two deflationary mechanisms for $AMY. One is that 5% of interest generated from borrowing and margin trading will buyback $AMY from market and burn those tokens. Another is that to assemble a higher level of Golden Cat NFT, Cat owners need to burn a certain amount of $AMY.\n",
  "Anarcho-Capitalism": "A political philosophy and school of thought that believes in removing centralized states in favor of self-ownership, private property and free markets. Many of the early adopters of Bitcoin were proponents of anarcho-capitalism, believing it would give power and control back to the masses.\n",

A money-market protocol similar to Maker, Compound and Synthetix, but one that facilitates capital efficient lending & borrowing via the issuance of synthetic tokens (eg DOLA) & non-synthetic credit (eg borrowing tokens such as ETH). Anchor launched on 25th February 2021.\n",
  "Anchor Protocol": "A savings protocol on the Terra blockchain that offers yield powered by block rewards of major Proof-of-Stake blockchains. Anchor offers a principal-protected stablecoin savings product that pays depositors a stable interest rate. It achieves this by stabilizing the deposit interest rate with block rewards accruing to assets that are used to borrow stablecoins. Anchor will thus offer DeFi’s benchmark interest rate, determined by the yield of the PoS blockchains with highest demand. Ultimately, they envision Anchor to become the gold standard for passive income on the blockchain.\n",
  "Anchoring Bias": "A behavioral bias in which the use of a psychological benchmark carries a disproportionately high weight in a market participant’s decision-making process. In the context of investing, one consequence of anchoring is that market participants with an anchoring bias tend to hold investments that have lost value because they have anchored their fair value estimate to the original price rather than to fundamentals. As a result, market participants assume greater risk by holding the investment in the hope the asset will return to its purchase price. Market participants are often aware that their anchor is imperfect and attempt to make adjustments to reflect subsequent information and analysis. However, these adjustments often produce outcomes that reflect the bias of the original anchors.\n",
  "Ancient Beast": "A turn based strategy indie game project, played against other people (or bots) in hot-seat or online modes, featuring a wide variety of units to acquire and put to good use in order to defeat all your opponents in battle.

The game is very accessible and playable for free, without enforcing any Pay-to-Play or Pay-to-Win elements.\n",
  "Angel Investor": "Also called a seed or private investor, angel investors actively seek out opportunities to provide funding for entrepreneurs or start-up companies. They are often individuals with high net worth who are seeking new methods of expanding their wealth while simultaneously helping to launch an up and coming venture. By investing, angel investors are not simply loaning funds to a project or company. Instead, they often require some percentage of ownership in the venture based on their initial investment. In some cases, the investment may occur continually, as the enterprise develops. But, it may also take place as a one-time contribution that helps the venture get started. Angel investing tends to be beneficial for both the entrepreneur and the early investor. For example, the investor may find an opportunity to capitalize on earning interest at a rate they will not find in the standard financial market. For the entrepreneur, they are receiving funding at a level they may not otherwise have access to by applying to the typical loan entities, especially as a start-up. Due to the risks involved, some angel investors also provide mentoring and business advice. This allows them to stimulate the venture’s success, so they are more likely to profit or at least recover their investment. Such support may come in different forms, from the planning to the development stage. It may also include help with networking, marketing, and advertising. Angel investors play a significant role in economic growth. Outside of their potential personal gains by investing in a start-up, their funding helps to launch innovative ventures. Many of which would otherwise never exist, given the limited access to traditional funding sources. These ventures, in turn, help to create jobs and contribute new products and services to the economy. Within the blockchain industry, angel investors are often participating in private sales that precede the public or crowd sales - also known as Initial Coin Offerings or ICO events.\n",
  "AngelDAO": "A Venture Decentralized Autonomous Organization supporting a wide variety of projects with funding, software development, network participation and community building.

  "Ankr Token": "Token that serves as payment on the Ankr platform and will play an essential role in our decentralized staking protocol: Stkr.\n",
  "Annual Percentage Rate": "The annual rate of interest charged to borrowers and paid to investors. Annual Percentage Rate (APR) is expressed as a percentage that represents the actual yearly cost of funds over the term of a loan or income earned on an investment. This includes any fees or additional costs associated with the transaction, but it does not take compounding into account. The APR provides consumers with a bottom-line number they can easily compare with rates from other lenders.\n",
  "Annual Percentage Yield": "A normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period of one year. APY figures allow a reasonable, single-point comparison of different offerings with varying compounding schedules.

  "Anthem": "Product of Chorus One. Anthem is a Multi-Network Staking Platform enabling users to manage their participation and to analyze their account data in various decentralized networks. Anthem supports staking on Celo, Cosmos, Oasis, Kava, and Terra. The core motivation to build Anthem arose from Chorus One's own needs as a staking provider: Currently, most accounting and tax regimes require individuals/enterprises to recognize revenues at the time received. When staking on Cosmos, this means that revenues occur every single block, or around 400,000 times a month. So far, there has been no public tool allowing users to see their historical staking rewards. Anthem changes that. Anthem provides stakers with a consistent, personalized dashboard that allows them to track, manage, and optimize how their staking assets are utilized across many different networks.\n",
  "Anti-money Laundering ": "A set of laws, regulations, and procedures intended to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income. The BSA and its implementing regulations require MSBs to develop, implement, and maintain an effective written anti-money laundering program (“AML program”) that is reasonably designed to prevent the MSB from being used to facilitate money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities. The AML program must, at a minimum: (a) incorporate policies, procedures and internal controls reasonably designed to assure ongoing compliance (including verifying customer identification, filing reports, creating and retaining records, and responding to law enforcement requests); (b) designate an individual responsible to assure day-to-day compliance with the program and BSA requirements; (c) provide training for appropriate personnel, including training in the detection of suspicious transactions; and, (d) provide for independent review to monitor and maintain an adequate program .\n",

  "API3": "A collaborative effort to build, manage and monetize decentralized APIs (dAPIs) at scale. To achieve this in a fully decentralized way, the incentives of the participants will be reconciled through the governance, security, and value capture utilities of the API3 token. The project will have a completely open and direct governance model, where any API3 token holder will be able to stake to obtain direct voting privileges in the API3 DAO. In addition, stakers will receive a portion of the dAPI revenue, inflationary staking rewards and any additional benefits that the DAO may decide on in the future. The staked API3 tokens will back an on-chain insurance service as collateral to provide dAPI users with quantifiable and trustless security guarantees.\n",
  "API3 Token": "The native token of the API3 project. It gives its holders the right to take part in the governance of the API3 ecosystem through the API3 DAO. To generate shares in the API3 DAO, token holders have to stake the API3 tokens into the insurance pool, which also gives them access to weekly staking rewards.\n",
  "Application Binary Interface": "An application binary interface (ABI) is a standardized method for engaging with smart contracts in a blockchain ecosystem. ABIs allow smart contracts to engage with external data, as well as with other contracts internal to the blockchain platform. ABIs are similar to application programming interfaces (APIs) in that they enable separate software systems to communicate and interact with each other.\n",
  "Application Programming Interface": "A computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.\n",
  "Application Specific Integrated Circuit": "Non-standard integrated circuits that have been designed for a specific use or application. Generally, an Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC) design will be undertaken for a product that will have a large production run, and the ASIC may contain a very large part of the electronics needed on a single integrated circuit. As may be imagined, the cost of an ASIC design is high, and therefore they tend to be reserved for high volume products.\n\nDespite the cost of an ASIC design, ASICs can be very cost effective for many applications where volumes are high. It is possible to tailor the ASIC design to meet the exact requirement for the product and using an ASIC can mean that much of the overall design can be contained in one integrated circuit and the number of additional components can be significantly reduced. As a result they are widely used in high volume products like cell phones or other similar applications, often for consumer products where volumes are higher, or for business products that are widely used.\n",
  "approved.zone": "Website to revoke approvals manually.\n",
  "APR Token": "Governance token of Apricot Finance.\n",
  "Apricot Finance": "A platform for decentralized financial solutions in the thriving Solana ecosystem. The project will launch initially with an over-collateralized loan protocol that differentiates itself by giving borrowers best-in-class borrowing power and low liquidation penalties with high predictability in outcome. As the platform expands, Apricot may tap into the concept of securitization in traditional finance to help manage a bad debt collateral pool accumulated through Apricots 2-hour liquidation guarantee program. Apricot also plans to launch a rich set of related products in near future, such as orderbook-based fixed rate loans, customizable financial derivatives, template-based high frequency operations, low-to-no collateral loans, etc., to accommodate a wide range of user needs.\n\nApricot will be running on the Solana blockchain, whose unique combination of high transaction throughput and ultralow time-to-finality provide a highly scalable and costeffective solution for the future of blockchains and decentralized finance.\n",
  "Apricot Lend": "Product of Apricot Finance. It is an over-collateralized lending protocol that also acts in borrowers interest by setting below-market collateralization requirements, lowering liquidation thresholds, and limiting liquidation penalties. While lenders interests are inherently protected by over 100% collateralization ratio and liquidation threshold, they believe a borrower-friendly model that attracts borrowing demand could prove to be mutually beneficial by driving up the deposit interest rate under our interest rate model.\n\nIn addition, Apricot Lend will establish a 2-hour liquidation guarantee, giving borrowers peace of mind that their positions can be cleared within a short time frame with highly predictable outcomes. When Apricot grows to a sufficient scale, they may choose to complement the lending model with a securitization-like mechanism and issue new tokens backed by the collaterals accumulated through Apricots liquidation guarantee program.\n",

The project is also building the Aragon Network, the world's first digital jurisdiction. The Aragon project is stewarded by the Aragon Association, a non-profit entity based in Zug, Switzerland, and governed by Aragon Network Token holders.\n",
  "ArbGas": "ArbGas is used by Arbitrum to track the cost of execution on an Arbitrum chain. It is similar in concept to Ethereum gas, in the sense that every Arbitrum Virtual Machine instruction has an ArbGas cost, and the cost of a computation is the sum of the ArbGas costs of the instructions in it.\n\nArbGas is not directly comparable to Ethereum gas. Arbitrum does not have a hard ArbGas limit, and in general an Arbitrum chain can consume many more ArbGas units per second of computation, compared to the number of Ethereum gas units in Ethereum's gas limit. Developers and users should think of ArbGas as much more plentiful and much cheaper per unit than Ethereum gas.\n\nIn the eventual production deployment of Arbitrum, a chain will be allowed to charge users a fee for ArbGas, to compensate the chain's validators for their expenses. However, the fee is set to zero by default in Arbitrum beta, for the convenience of developers and users.\n",
  "Arbitrage": "The simultaneous buying and selling of securities, currency, or commodities in different markets or in derivative forms in order to take advantage of differing prices for the same asset. The situation creates an opportunity for a risk-free profit for the trader.\n\nArbitrage provides a mechanism to ensure that prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time. With advancements in technology, it has become extremely difficult to profit from pricing errors in the market. Many traders have computerized trading systems set to monitor fluctuations in similar financial instruments. Any inefficient pricing setups are usually acted upon quickly, and the opportunity is eliminated, often in a matter of seconds.\n",
  "Arbitrary Jump with Function Type Variable": "Solidity supports function types. That is, a variable of function type can be assigned with a reference to a function with a matching signature. The function saved to such variable can be called just like a regular function. The problem arises when a user has the ability to arbitrarily change the function type variable and thus execute random code instructions. As Solidity doesn't support pointer arithmetics, it's impossible to change such variable to an arbitrary value. However, if the developer uses assembly instructions, such as mstore or assign operator, in the worst case scenario an attacker is able to point a function type variable to any code instruction, violating required validations and required state changes. The use of assembly should be minimal. A developer should not allow a user to assign arbitrary values to function type variables.\n",
  "Arbitrum": "A suite of Ethereum scaling solutions that enables high-throughput, low cost smart contracts while remaining trustlessly secure. Arbitrum has three modes: AnyTrust Channels, AnyTrust Sidechains, and Arbitrum Rollup. Arbitrum Rollup is currently live on testnet.\n",
  "Arbitrum Rollup": "A super scaled Layer 2 (L2) chain. Like all Rollups, the Arbitrum Rollup chain is built on top of and secured by the Ethereum blockchain, and all transaction data is logged on Ethereum. From a user and developer perspective, interacting with Arbitrum feels exactly like interacting with Ethereum. Arbitrum supports the same RPC interface as Ethereum, supports all EVM languages, and natively supports all Ethereum tooling without any special adapters. The only way in which an Arbitrum Rollup chain does not resemble Ethereum is the cost: transactions on Arbitrum cost a small fraction of what they would if run natively on Ethereum.\n\nPorting contracts from Ethereum to Arbitrum is fast and simple; there's no need to change any code or download any new software. Arbitrum has full support for the EVM just like Ethereum. This means that all smart contract languages that work with Ethereum (e.g. all versions of Solidity, Vyper Yul), also work natively with Arbitrum. Similarly all standard frontend Ethereum tooling (e.g. Truffle, Hardhat, The Graph, ethers.js) also work natively with Arbitrum. It natively supports all Ethereum tooling.\n\nAlthough developers and users don't need to download any custom software to deploy contracts and interact with the Arbitrum Rollup chain, some users may want to validate the chain for themselves. When using Arbitrum Rollup, the security is guaranteed by the fact that any single honest user can guarantee that the system runs correctly. Validating the Arbitrum chain is fully permissionless; all you need to do is download the Arbitrum Validator node software and point their node at the chain. To issue or dispute an assertion, they simply need to place a stake that they will get back after the claim is resolved (assuming they acted honestly).\n\nIn short, Arbitrum enables users to interact with and deploy smart contracts at a fraction of the cost of using Ethereum natively, and using all the same tooling they use to interact with Ethereum today without compromising on security or decentralization. No custom tooling is required to use the chain, but anyone can elect to validate the chain.\n",
  "Arbol": "Firm that provides weather risk management services for the agricultural sector.\n",
  "Arboreum": "Protocol that builds and manages credit networks of lenders, borrowers, and trusting supporters. Our technology mitigates risk for lenders whilst leveraging supporter trust to improve credit access for borrowers. Our risk-underwriting model treats the reputation of a borrower as a proxy for their credit score, allowing us to gauge risk and price loans, even in the absence of a formal credit profile. At the core of our solution is the notion of `lines of trust', where trust is defined as the maximum that one is willing to allow another participant to borrow. Borrowers source loans from their direct trust lines, and lenders novate their loan exposure by negotiating lower interest-rate loans from their own trust lines in turn (which repeats as far as possible).\n",
  "ArbOS": "The Arbitrum operating system that sits on top of the Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM) and is responsible for isolating untrusted contracts from one another, tracking and limiting their resource usage using ArbGas, and managing the economic model that collects fees from users to fund the operation of a chain's validators. ArbOS gives Arbitrum a great deal of flexibility by offloading work that would have been done in the L1 smart contract into cheaper L2 code.\n",
  "Arcade City": "A ride-sharing platform that allows drivers to connect with customers peer-to-peer within the Ethereum platform. Arcade City is the #1 project building decentralized Uber. We aim to decentralize the entire corporate 'gig economy' including ridesharing, deliveries and more.

After four years of daily operation, that network now has industry-leading metrics on driver earnings, driver retention, and cost-efficiency. Arcade City is coming to California and Brazil, then everywhere else.\n",
  "Arcade Token": "The official cryptocurrency of Arcade City. Starting in our app update v4.2 in late October, users will earn Arcade Tokens for building their local Arcade City networks. Tokens will be used for growing and governing local networks, primarily via driver-run cooperatives we call guilds. Users will be able to create guilds in the v4.2 update later this month. Any user may create a guild for essentially any peaceful purpose. Guilds have a name, mission statement, and charter of policies they themselves write and enforce.

  "ARCx": "A decentralized scoring protocol that powers on-chain identity through the issuance of a DeFi Passport. The first page, or element, in the DeFi Passport is an on-chain credit score. This initial score is issued to an identity based on an assessment of the address' on-chain activity.\n\nDuring Phase 1 of the launch, identities who have been issued their DeFi Passport can access 'Passport Enabled Farms,' which exclusively offer high APYs that are incentivized by ARCx and their genesis launch partners.\n\nWith time, DeFi Passport holders will then be issued with a Credit Score which will mark the commencement of Phase 2. This Credit Score can then enable dynamic terms for borrowing depending on the borrower themselves.\n\nThe ARCx DeFi Passport is designed to be a staple of users and protocols in Decentralized Finance on multiple blockchains. Beyond the ARCx Credit Score constituting its first page, the applications are endless for the pseudonymous, decentralized profiling and assessment of identities based on on-chain activity.\n\nIn the near future, ARCx plans to continue to add more scores and pages to the DeFi Passport. These would include:\n\n \"Yield Farming Scores\" that evaluates whether a farmer has a long-term mindset, which shows support for a protocol's long term growth---as opposed to farming and immediately selling. A higher Yield Farming score based on these parameters could potentially enable favorable APY to incentivize a higher quality and activist community.\n \"Airdrop Score\" that evaluates whether an address on-chain holds airdrops---again, showing support for a protocol's long term growth---or immediately sells their tokens.\n \"Governance Score\" that signals to protocols and builders how actively a user is involved in on-chain governance. Beyond metrics of activity in governance, the kinds of decisions a user makes on-chain and the nature of their governance in given protocol(s) could be very telling of motives and future behavior.\n \"Trader Scores\" which determine the differences between bots and real identities to give different rates based on how a protocol wants to interact with a counterparty. For example, a DEX could enable lower trading fees for identities compared to that for bots.\n",

  "Armor Finance": "The first dynamic asset protection brokerage for DeFi, built on Nexus. Nexus currently insures about $222m or under 2% of over $11 billion total value locked in DeFi so far. While a much needed addition to the digital asset ecosystem, Nexus is optimized for investments where the value and duration of asset deployments are known in advance. There is a gap in the market for dynamic coverage across a wide range of protocols with an adjustable coverage value and expiration curve. Armor can help Nexus expand to cover the entirety of value locked and ensure it tracks along with the exponential growth rates long term. Underwritten by Nexus, Armor evolves digital asset insurance from static chunks of coverage toward dynamic risk management customized to client demands and circumstances. Instead of sticking to a fixed amount, a set timeframe, and expiration date, all of these inputs can be dynamically recommended and modified at any time.

  "Arrow DFMs": "Arrow DFMs implement a low-level protocol for creating and settling options on publicly available asset prices. Cash-settlement operates through a network of decentralized aggregate counterparties (DACs) financed by liquidity providers in exchange for platform income.\n\nThe Arrow platform is inspired in part by Nobel laureate economists Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu who showed prices of financial assets can be reduced to prices of a core set of contracts called Arrow-Debreu securities. The economies of scale suggested by this irreducible set of securities are embodied in the Arrow decentralized financial market (DFM).\n\nEach Arrow DFM is built around an underlier. The underlier can be any quantity that can be accessed by a public API. The DFM contains a standardized set of claims whose payoffs are contingent on the value of this underlier. As an example, a quant user might choose to build a DFM around a portfolio of stocks, and create call options that payoff if the value of the portfolio of stocks is above some level in the future. Similarly, a defi user may build a DFM around ETH and create put option spreads on ETH.\n\nDFMs live on the blockchain network where they were deployed. The Arrow application layer allows users to access, deploy and combine DFMs. The DFM can be used to replicate any claim to the reference assets or their derivative claims, including puts, calls, option spreads and synths. Assets can also be combined across DFMs to create fixed-floating swaps, total return swaps and a complete array of hybrid claims.\n\nDFMs are long-lived, so after initialization their main purpose is to facilitate the creation and settlement of claims written on their underliers. The adjacent figure illustrates that once a user has initialized a DFM around an underlier, say 'U', other users can create and exchange options on 'U' by accessing the initial user's DFM.\n",
  "Art Blocks": "A first of its kind platform focused on genuinely programmable on demand generative content that is stored immutably on the Ethereum Blockchain. Users pick a style that they like, pay for the work, and a randomly generated version of the content is created by an algorithm and sent to their Ethereum account. The resulting piece might be a static image, 3D model, or an interactive experience. Each output is different and there are endless possibilities for the types of content that can be created on the platform.\n",
  "ArtBlock": "An Austrian blockchain company. They combine their know-how and blockchain technology to create a solution that facilitates the trade of artwork between artists and collectors.\n\nThey tokenize existing art and make it available on the Ethereum blockchain. All official ArtBlock tokens are redeemable for the equivalent piece of art or art object. Easily hodl real art or objects of art in your Ethereum wallet without necessarily having to store it. Redeemable anytime.\n",
  "ARTH Coin": "Coin created by MahaDAO. ARTH is a new type of currency designed to not be pegged to government-owned currencies (like US Dollar, Euro, or Chinese Yuan), but still remain relatively stable (unlike Gold and Bitcoin). Without being influenced by government-owned currencies, ARTH will be immune to inflation. Through stability, ARTH also becomes a superior choice of currency for means of trade. This is unlike Gold or Bitcoin, which are used more as a store of value rather than a medium of exchange. ARTH does this by being pegged to a basket of assets that represent strong hedges of each other; so that if one asset depreciates in buying power, the other appreciates because it acts as a hedge against the first asset, keeping the net buying power of the entire basket unchanged.\n",
  "Arweave": "A new type of storage that backs data with sustainable and perpetual endowments, allowing users and developers to truly store data forever – for the very first time. As a collectively owned hard drive that never forgets, Arweave allows us to remember and preserve valuable information, apps, and history indefinitely. By preserving history, it prevents others from rewriting it.\n",
  "Arwen WASM VM": "The virtual machine of Elrond Network. Because the Arwen VM executes WebAssembly, it also means that it can execute smart contracts written in any programming language that can be compiled to WASM bytecode, such as C, C++, C#, Rust, Go, TypeScript and many other.\n\nArwen was built to be as fast and secure as possible, but without adding unneeded restrictions to what smart contracts can do: the API provided by Arwen, called the Elrond Environment Interface, is comprehensive and easy to use.\n\nArwen is a stateless VM. When a smart contract is being executed, it is not allowed to write directly neither to the blockchain, nor to the storage. This is an important design decision, because it obviates the need for reverting operations. So, instead of writing directly to the state, the API will accumulate the changes introduced by the smart contract execution into a transient data structure, which is then applied to the storage and / or blockchain, but only at the end of the execution, and only in case of success. Reading the global state is, of course, permitted at any time. In effect, the global state remains unaffected until the execution ends.\n\nTo add an extra layer of stability and security, Arwen runs in its own process, separate from the node itself. The two processes exchange information via a collection of anonymous in-memory pipes. This means that memory segmentation itself, as realized by the OS, is used as a protective layer. Moreover, the execution of WASM bytecode always happens in a tightly controlled sandbox, and the memory of Arwen's process is inaccessible.\n\nThe Arwen VM executes code using Wasmer as an execution engine, which operates as a just-in-time streaming compiler. Due to the design of Wasmer, the smart contracts are executed at near-native speed.\n",
  "ASGARDEX": "A reference DEX that utilizes the THORChain network to provide a user interface to perform cross-chain swaps between any chain that has been integrated into the network. ASGARDEX has not been released yet. It is due to go live alongside mainnet, once cross-chain swaps have been validated on chaosnet.\n",

  "ASH Token": "A social currency backed by curated extinction. The value, the utility and the identity of $ASH is balanced by its users. $ASH is a fair launch token that started with 0 supply. Liquidity Pools and Swaps are created by the community. $ASH can be mined by burning NFTs, bringing a dynamic balance to scarcity. For every NFT a holder burns, they make the rest rarer, favoring their collectors. $ASH currently has 2 burn tiers where Pak NFTs yield more ash than others. Both tiers follow the same bonding curve mechanism with different multipliers. Pak NFTs tier curve starts with 1000 $ASH and others start with 2 $ASH yield. Halving happens at 5M token supply impacting all burn tiers.\n",
  "Ashdraked": "A situation where you lose all your money, more specifically when you lose all your money shorting Bitcoin.

  "ASIC-resistant": "A property of a cryptocurrency that is \"immune\" to ASIC mining. An ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency has its protocol and mining algorithm configured in such a way that using ASIC machines to mine the coin is either impossible or brings no significant benefit when compared to traditional GPU mining. In some cases, using ASICs on ASIC-resistant cryptocurrencies may be even worse than using the more conventional hardware. However, the process of making a cryptocurrency ASIC-resistant is a defensive game, which requires continued development and modifications. This is due to the reason that ASIC designers and manufacturers are constantly producing new models of ASIC miners, and sometimes, the newer models are able to bypass the ASIC-resistance of certain cryptocurrencies.\n",
  "Ask price": "The term represents the minimum price that a seller is willing to take for that same security.\n",
  "Assert Violation": "The Solidity assert() function is meant to assert invariants. Properly functioning code should never reach a failing assert statement. A reachable assertion can mean one of two things: (1) A bug exists in the contract that allows it to enter an invalid state; or (2) The assert statement is used incorrectly, e.g. to validate inputs. Consider whether the condition checked in the assert() is actually an invariant. If not, replace the assert() statement with a require() statement. If the exception is indeed caused by unexpected behaviour of the code, fix the underlying bug(s) that allow the assertion to be violated.\n",

ADOP defines the framework and core algorithms of the Automated Options Market Making Mechanism (AOMM). Based on the key infrastructure On-Chain Shared Liquidity Capital Pool, Asteria realized the peer-to-pool trading infrastructure for decentralized option markets.\n\nADOP implements Delta Hedging engine as professional risk management, with Aggregator mechanism dynamically adjusting positions on spot, perpetual swap and option markets, elevating the capital efficiency of the shared liquidity pool, which greatly enhances the system stability and ensures the safety of market makers' capital.\n\nMeanwhile, financial engineering technologies such as Black-Scholes model and dynamic Implied Volatility estimation are expertly deployed for option pricing and quantity quotations. ADOP also applies the Non Fungible Tokens on ERC1155 protocol to not only map the rights and obligations of options participants, but also integrate into platform token mining scheme. NFT, by its unalterable and transferable nature, would ignite options OTC market, significantly expanding options trading dimensions and boosting the total market liquidity.\n\nAsteria will become one of the Airnodes, the First-Party Providers of API3, providing Oracle services as professional indicators of the underlying option prices and Implied Volatility (IV). Also, Layer2 Optimistic Rollup (OR) solution will be integrated in Asteria Version 2, which will instantly improve system scalability, and reduce transaction and operational costs.\n\nIn short, ADOP brings AOMM mechanism on-chain and implements intelligent risk management and specialized option pricing model by smart contracts, as well as integrated with state-of-the-art Oracle and L2 solutions, to build Asteria, the next generation of decentralized option trading platform as Professional as Morgan Stanley and as Straightforward as Uniswap.\n",
  "Asteria Token": "An ERC20 platform token of Asteria. The value of ATAT comes from the option transaction and settlement fee revenue of option automated trading.

  "Async Art Bot": "A twitter bot that tweets whenever Async Art's #ProgrammableArt gets updated.\n",
  "Asynchronous": "In computer science, asynchrony refers to the occurrence of events that are independent of the main program. In an asynchronous system, operations are not coordinated by a global clock signal, but rather events (changes in the system). Asynchronous systems do not depend on external signals or messages for their reliable operation. Asynchronous systems are often designed with a modular framework. In such systems, each module can operate independently and has the ability to communicate with other modules. These interconnected modules then together form a working system. Asynchronous communication is when data can be transmitted irregularly, instead of in a steady stream. Common examples include email or online forums, where participants send messages at different times. Blockchains can be asynchronous or semi-synchronous networks. Asynchronous networks do not supply the nodes with any feedback about the status of the information being sent, which can lead to nodes having different views on the overall state of the network. Essentially, nodes don't have to wait for other nodes to receive their messages, which can increase the transaction throughput. Semi-synchronous networks aim to ensure that there is never a split in the network’s global state. If the network is partitioned, consensus between the nodes will slow down until it is restored again. Asynchronous or semi-synchronous blockchain networks can be designed whether to prioritize consistency or availability. If the network wants to prioritize availability, all transactions are added without any downtime. If the network wants to prioritize consistency, some transactions might not be processed or halted until all the previous transactions are confirmed. Some blockchain designs use an implementation of Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) called Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT). It mathematically guarantees that consensus is eventually achieved even if an attacker controls almost a third of the network. Asynchronous in this context means that no assumptions are made about timing.\n",
  "Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance": "The first layer of the Byzantine Fault Tolerance Delegated Proof-of-Stake (BFT-DPoS) consensus mechanism. Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT) uses a two-stage block confirmation mechanism, wherin a two-thirds supermajority of block producers confirm each block twice.

  "At The Money": "An At The Money (ATM) option has the greatest uncertainty. It is the most sensitive to changes in the cryptocurrency price and volatility, and time passing. This can be good or bad. An example of an ATM CALL option would be where you buy a WBTC $50,000 strike price CALL option, and the current market price for WBTC is $50,000. An example of an ATM PUT option would be where you buy a WBTC $50,000 strike price PUT option, and the current market price for WBTC is $50,000\n",
  "Atari Token": "A cryptocurrency built using the Ethereum protocol (ERC20) and Decentralized Ledger Technology.

Managing resources will require critical strategic decision making. Players seeking the monetary rewards available ingame will need to carefully balance their operating expenses against income derived. Operating expenses, such as personnel for mining equipment, fuel for ships, and repairs for damages will all need to be paid in ATLAS. It will also serve as the predominant currency within the NFT marketplace.\n\nA fraction of the game currency will be available through various stages of the Galactic Asset Offering (GAO), leading up to full launch of the title. Upon completion of the GAO, ATLAS can only be earned through in-game activity or sales by other players.

Atomic swaps can take place directly between blockchains of different cryptocurrencies, or they can be conducted off-chain, away from the main blockchain. \n\nThey first came into prominence in September 2017, when an atomic swap between Decred and Litecoin was conducted. Since then, other startups and decentralized exchanges have allowed users the same facility. For example, Lightning Labs, a startup that uses bitcoin’s lightning network for transactions, has conducted off-chain swaps using the technology. Cryptocurrencies and decentralized exchanges, such as 0x and Altcoin.io, have also incorporated the technology.\n",

  "Automated Exchange": "A relatively new form of exchange that has emerged in the cryptocurrency markets is the automated exchange. These exchanges do away with order books altogether and instead use a smart contract and its inventory to determine prices for exchange.\n",
  "Automated Market Maker ": "A type of decentralized exchange (DEX) protocol that relies on a mathematical formula to price assets. Instead of using an order book like a traditional exchange, assets are priced according to a pricing algorithm.\n\nThis formula can vary with each protocol. For example, Uniswap uses x * y = k, where x is the amount of one token in the liquidity pool, and y is the amount of the other. In this formula, k is a fixed constant, meaning the pool’s total liquidity always has to remain the same. Other AMMs will use other formulas for the specific use cases they target. The similarity between all of them, however, is that they determine the prices algorithmically.\n\nAn AMM works similarly to an order book exchange in that there are trading pairs – for example, ETH/DAI. However, traders don't need to have a counterparty (another trader) on the other side to make a trade. Instead, they interact with a smart contract that “makes” the market for you.\n",

  "Average Coin Dormancy": "Metric that describes the average number of days that each spent coin had remained dormant before it was moved.\n\nDormancy considers the total volume of coin-days destroyed and divides by the total coin volume transacted to give an average spent lifespan on a per unit coin basis (i.e. spent lifespan per 1 BTC).\n\nDormancy is a derivative of Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) however is functionally similar to Average Spent Outputs Lifespan (ASOL) and has a similar interpretation. Where ASOL measures the average lifespan on a per transaction basis (spent output) , Dormancy measures the average lifespan normalised on a per unit coin basis.\n\n High dormancy values mean that, on average, coins spent that day had been held for longer periods of time in an illiquid state and may be being spent back into liquid circulation. \n Low dormancy values mean the coins being spent that day have are relatively young, signalling that older coins are generally remaining unspent, and on-chain volume is characteristic of more day-to-day traffic.\n\nMetric coined by Reginald D. Smith in February 2018.\n",
  "Average Directional Index": "A technical analysis indicator used by some traders to determine the strength of a trend. The trend can be either up or down, and this is shown by two accompanying indicators, the negative directional indicator (-DI) and the positive directional indicator (+DI). Therefore, the ADX commonly includes three separate lines. These are used to help assess whether a trade should be taken long or short, or if a trade should be taken at all.\n",
  "Average Spent Output Lifespan": "The average lifespan (in days) of all spent transaction outputs. Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) highlights on a macro level the lifespan of coins on a per transaction output basis that were spent that day. This provides insight into the balance between short-term (young coins) and long-term (old coins) spending behaviour over a period of time.\n\nGenerally speaking, ASOL can be considered in the following framework:\n ASOL provides a more sensitive view than MSOL on the aggregate spending behaviour. It often trends higher with market volatility and changes in market sentiment and structure as older, dormant coins are spent back into circulation.\n High values typically indicate an increased proportion of network traffic are old coins being spent, often associated with long term holders taking advantage of high market volatility.\n Low values typically indicate day-to-day traffic comprised mainly of young coins being spent, often associated with traders and short term holders.\n\nNote that ASOL account only for the lifespan of the spent outputs and does not consider coin volume moved (i.e. ignores how many BTC units are moved). Two outputs which are 100-days old but worth 0.1BTC and 100BTC respectively, have identical weights in the ASOL calculation.\n\nASOL (Average Spent Output Lifespan) is defined as the mean age (in days) of all spent transaction outputs in a given time period. In order to account for change and eliminate obvious relay transactions, outputs with a lifespan of less than 1 hour are discarded.\n\nCoined by Renato Shirakashi in October 2019.\n",

  "Axion": "A blockchain powered venture fund alongside high interest time-locked savings deposits (stakes) that earn investors high interest of ~8% plus additional dividends. Axion also acts as a scalable, spendable global currency with its native token AXN. Pay for anything in everyday life using AXN and BTC dividends with their strategic partnership with Connect Financial, who offer a true world class VISA-sponsored crypto credit card that works directly with their native digital token AXN, Bitcoin, and more. \n\nAxion allows anyone to earn on their investment via venture capital auctions and time-locked deposits on the blockchain with the AXN token. Share rates in the Axion ecosystem are the most valuable asset as they determine the payouts drawn from reward pools / investment pools / dividend pools. Shares as they are in the Axion ecosystem are earned by staking AXN, with the share rate determined by the accumulation of users' share(s) divided by the total shares in the ecosystem multiplied by the payout for each day's reward cycle. Network participants earn higher share rate(s) by staking AXN for larger and longer periods of time (much like CDs) in order to accumulate more dividends/rewards.\n\nStaking AXN tokens earns investors liquid dividends while simultaneously earning interest on their principal AXN that is staked on their platform. Their innovative dividend-producing mechanisms provide investors and AXN shareholders rewards in Bitcoin and other top cryptocurrencies, which are immediately liquid while their AXN accrues interest upon its principal via their smart contracts for the users' desired period of time, based on their stake length.\n\nTrust and transparency in the Axion network is based on mathematical principles, blockchain technology, and smart contracts on the Ethereum network. Additionally, their highly experienced team and cooperative community members offer an unparalleled level of support to ensure a simplified, safe, and secure process in understanding and participating in their decentralized platform.\n",

  "BABL Token": "The governance token for the Babylon protocol. It ensures that Babylon is owned by its users. The team plans to distribute 69% of $BABL tokens to the community, dynamically rewarding stakeholders for investing, generating ideas, curating plays, and managing communities based on a community’s performance and AUM. The protocol goal is to have the best investment communities in the digital asset class. The protocol is designed to ensure that all the participants are aligned in their individual motivations to achieve this common goal.\n",
  "Babylon": "A community-led asset management protocol that enables users to invest in DeFi together. It's built on the Ethereum network and it's non-custodial, transparent, permissionless, and governed by the community.\n\nBabylon has a two-layer governance system. The protocol will be managed by the holders of the governance token, $BABL, which will be used to vote on changes to the protocol and decide on the best use of the protocol treasury. \n\nBabylonians will be able to create investment communities (called \"Gardens\") and invite people to deposit capital, suggest investment Strategies, vote on Strategies, and earn rewards. Gardens will be governed by their members (called \"LPs\").\n",
  "Back-Running": "Back-running occurs when a transaction sender wishes to have their transaction ordered immediately after some unconfirmed \"target transaction\".\n\nExample: A back-running bot that back-runs new token listings. Bot monitors the Ethereum mempool for new pairs being created on Uniswap. If it finds a new pair the bot places a buy transaction immediately behind the initial liquidity. The bot swoops in and buys as many tokens as possible (but not all of them as there needs to be an opportunity for others to buy tokens as well).The bot then waits for the price to go up as other traders buy the token from Uniswap and proceeds to sell back the tokens at a higher price. The key in this strategy is to be the first to buy tokens, but only after the token has been launched.\n\nIn order to maximise their changes of being mined immediately after their target, a typical backrunner will send many identical transactions, with gas price identical to that of the target transaction, sometimes from different accounts, in order to increase the chances that one of their transactions is ordered after the target but before any competitor.\n",
  "Backdoor": "A backdoor refers to any method that can circumnavigate regular authentication and authorization procedures to gain root or high-level access to a system, computer, application, or network. Backdoors are commonly installed through remote file inclusion (RFI), which identifies a weak component in an application or a network. This type of channel allows direct control over an infected device to manipulate data, deploy more malware, or create a zombie network of infected computers for criminal activity.\n",
  "Backstop Module": "Part of the Auction module, the Backstop Module contains the ETH and stablecoins pre-deposited that have a priority position on the auction in the case of a Shortfall Event occurrence. It is a smart contract-based deposit pool that acts as a buy order for the AAVE token at a price agreed-on by the protocol governance in the case of a Shortfall Event, to act as a buyer of last resort. Back-stoppers are incentivized to have liquidity in the Backstop, as protocol fees are shared with them. In case of backstop buy back occurrence, the AAVE purchased by the backstop is distributed proportionally to backstop LPs, or they can directly deposit back their newly acquired AAVE in the staking module.\n",
  "Backtesting": "The general method for seeing how well a strategy or model would have done ex-post. Backtesting assesses the viability of a trading strategy by discovering how it would play out using historical data. If backtesting works, traders and analysts may have the confidence to employ it going forward. The underlying theory is that any strategy that worked well in the past is likely to work well in the future, and conversely, any strategy that performed poorly in the past is likely to perform poorly in the future. When testing an idea on historical data, it is beneficial to reserve a time period of historical data for testing purposes. If it is successful, testing it on alternate time periods or out-of-sample data can help confirm its potential viability.\n",
  "BACON Token": "The core membership, governance, and unit of exchange token for the BaconDAO ecosystem. The current and future utilities of $BACON are as follows:\n\n Access content and services such as Bitcoin and Altcoin market analysis, Altcoin gem picks in BSC, NFT, Polkadot, and other trending niches, token sale alerts, members-only chat, VirtualBacon’s alpha signals, news, and more.\n Access to exclusive private sale allocations\n Pay for services offered in community such as 1-on-1 coaching sessions with VirtualBacon\n Vote on BaconDAO governance decisions such as VirtualBacon’s video ideas, new channels for trending narratives, and community improvements\n Access early sales of BaconDAO incubated NFT collectibles\n Receive airdrop of exclusive VirtualBacon NFTs\n Tip other contributors in the community\n",

  "Bad Randomness": "Pseudorandom number generation on the blockchain is generally unsafe. There are a number of reasons for this, including: (1) The blockchain does not provide any cryptographically secure source of randomness. Block hashes in isolation are cryptographically random, however, a malicious miner can modify block headers, introduce additional transactions, and choose not to publish blocks in order to influence the resulting hashes. Therefore, miner-influenced values like block hashes and timestamps should never be used as a source of randomness; (2) Everything in a contract is publicly visible. Random numbers cannot be generated or stored in the contract until after all lottery entries have been stored; (3) Computers will always be faster than the blockchain. Any number that the contract could generate can potentially be precalculated off-chain before the end of the block. A common workaround for the lack of on-chain randomness is using a commit and reveal scheme. Here, each user submits the hash of their secret number. When the time comes for the random number to be generated, each user sends their secret number to the contract which then verifies it matches the hash submitted earlier and xors them together. Therefore no participant can observe how their contribution will affect the end result until after everyone has already committed to a value. However, this is also vulnerable to DoS attacks, since the last person to reveal can choose to never submit their secret. Even if the contract is allowed to move forward without everyone's secrets, this gives them influence over the end result. In general, we do not recommend commit and reveal schemes.\n",

Bakers are Tezos community members who possess a minimum amount of XTZ, and enough hardware and software expertise to run a baking node within the Tezos Proof-of-Stake network. Through a process of token staked delegation, bakers may also produce blocks and earn rewards on behalf of non-Bakers within the Tezos ecosystem.\n",
  "Baking": "Akin to the process of staking in many Proof-of-Stake models, Baking is the process of adding new blocks to the Tezos blockchain. The baking process involves adding, signing, and verifying new blocks, and depositing a specified amount of XTZ as collateral to guarantee honest behavior.\n",
  "BAL Governance Token": "Governance token for Balancer Protocol. BALs are a key way of decentralizing the governance of the protocol such that it remains resilient over time, and protected from the failure of any single stakeholder. The team expects token holders to help guide the protocol to its fullest potential through experimentation and active participation. For example, implementing new functionality, deploying the protocol on additional smart contract blockchains beyond Ethereum, using layer 2 solutions for scaling, introducing a protocol level fee, etc. Anything contentious will certainly go to the BAL token holders for review. The total supply of BAL tokens will be capped at 100M.\n",
  "Balance Freeze Functionality": "On the Ripple network, balance freeze is the function through which Ripple gateways freeze or halt transactions in order to prevent any abuse of the system for illicit activity. Balance freeze functionality is a powerful security feature that can only be applied to currencies issued on the Ripple network, and not on the XRP token itself.\n",
  "Balancer": "A n-dimensional automated market-maker built on Ethereum. It allows anyone to create or add liquidity to customizable pools and earn trading fees. Instead of the traditional constant product AMM model, Balancer’s formula is a generalization that allows any number of tokens in any weights or trading fees. Another way to view Balancer is as an inverse ETF: instead of paying fees to portfolio managers to rebalance your portfolio, you collect fees from traders, who continuously rebalance your portfolio by following arbitrage opportunities. Balancer protocol is designed to be composable and has a few types of pools: 1) Private Pools where the only owner can contribute liquidity and has full permissions over the pool, being able to update any of its parameters. 2) Shared Pools where the pool’s tokens, weights, and fees are permanently set and the pool creator has no special privileges. Anyone may add liquidity to shared pools and ownership of the pool’s liquidity is tracked with a specific token called BPT - Balancer Pool Token. 3) Smart Pools which are a variation of a private pool where the controller is a smart contract, allowing for any arbitrary logic/restrictions on how pool parameters can be changed. Smart pools may also accept liquidity from anyone and issue BPTs to track ownership.\n",

  "BANANA Token": "The native token of ApeSwap. There's currently no hard cap on the supply of BANANA token, making it an inflationary token. Community members often point to this as a cause for concern, and while the founding apes certainly understand the wish for a hard cap, there's a big reason that they don't expect to set one in the near future: BANANA's primary function is to incentivize providing liquidity to the exchange. Without block rewards, there would be much less of an incentive to provide liquidity (LP fees etc. would remain).\n",
  "Bancor": "A fully on-chain liquidity protocol that can be implemented on any smart contract-enabled blockchain. The Bancor Protocol is an open-source standard for liquidity pools, which in turn provides an endpoint for automated market-making (buying / selling tokens) against a smart contract.

Our implementation can be easily integrated into any application enabling value exchanges. Our implementation is open source and permissionless, and ecosystem participants are encouraged to contribute to and enhance the Bancor Protocol.\n",
  "Bancor Network Token": "Native token of the Bancor Network. Every liquidity pool on Bancor holds BNT (Bancor's Network Token) in its reserves as well as the \"base token\" receiving liquidity. BNT serves as the intermediary token connecting pools in the network and across blockchains. For example, a trade from DAI to BAT has the following conversion path: DAI > BNT > BAT. Users who trade on Bancor do not need to hold BNT; however, users creating a liquidity pool on Bancor or providing liquidity to an existing pool must hold BNT. Following the launch of the BancorDAO, BNT will also be used to vote on key attributes of the Bancor Protocol.\n",

  "BarnBridge": "A fluctuations derivatives protocol for hedging yield sensitivity and market price. Before the advent of smart contract technology it was close to impossible to track & attribute yield to a divided allotment of capital, trustlessly & transparently, to provide hedges against any and all fluctuations. Conceptually, you can build derivative products from any type of market driven fluctuation to hedge various risks. Examples include, but are not limited to, interest rate sensitivity, fluctuations in underlying market price, fluctuations in predictive market odds, fluctuations in default rates across mortgages, fluctuations in commodity prices, and a seemingly infinite number of market based fluctuations to hedge a particular position. We plan to create the first cross platform derivatives protocol for any and all fluctuations. To start, we will focus on yield sensitivity & market price. Downstream, we plan to introduce a far wider variety of hedges against fluctuations in the decentralized ecosystem. BarnBridge aims to be platform and asset agnostic. You can reduce the risk of digital assets & digital asset yield sensitivity by breaking them into essentially infinite, separate, dollar-denominated chunks, or tranches, and building derivatives off these tranches. BarnBridge aims to smooth out the risk curve and offer layered risk management to both DeFi & tradFi investors by building more efficient debt & yield based derivatives.\n",

Once governance is launched, BELT holders will control the Belt Finance protocol across different chains. 50% of swap fees from each swap transaction on Belt Finance is used to buyback BELT and burned (sent to the delete address). The remaining 50% is given as a reward to liquidity providers. 8% of yield is used to buyback BELT and burned (sent to the delete address). The remainder of the yield is given as a reward to liquidity providers.\n",
  "Benchmark": "A standard that functions as a point of reference. Within the financial industry, a benchmark is a measurement standard which can be used to gauge the performance of a particular asset or investment portfolio. Among the most common forms of benchmarks are the so-called indexes, which are basically financial instruments used to represent a group of individual market prices or a collection of data points. Different benchmarks have been created for a variety of asset classes, such as securities, bonds, stocks, and cryptocurrencies. A popular example of a benchmark is the S&P 500 index, which considers the market capitalization of 500 large US companies. These companies are elected by a specialized committee, following a weighting methodology.\n",
  "BENQI": "A decentralized non-custodial liquidity market protocol, built on Avalanche. The protocol enables users to effortlessly lend, borrow, and earn interest with their digital assets. Depositors providing liquidity to the protocol may earn passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralized manner.\n\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) has grown substantially in the last 2 years. As most of DeFi's activity is currently conducted on Ethereum, the network has started to experience congestion problems that have resulted in high network fees. This has proven to be a significant barrier for both old and new users with smaller capital to justify engaging in DeFi.\n\nBENQI aims to alleviate these problems by providing a Liquidity Market Protocol on a highly scalable and decentralized platform. With a focus on approachability, ease of use, and low fees, BENQI will democratize access to decentralized financial products by providing permissionless lending and borrowing where users can:\n\n1. Instantly supply to and withdraw liquidity from a shared liquidity market\n2. Instantly borrow from a liquidity market using their supplied assets as collateral\n3. Have a live and transparent view of interest rates around the clock based on the asset's market supply and demand\n",
  "BENQI Token": "The QI token is an native asset on Avalanche and oversees the entire ecosystem of the BENQI protocol, including the Treasury, and future iterations of the protocol.\n\nQI is required to vote and decide on the outcome of proposals through BENQI Improvement Proposals (BIPs). The protocol will initially be governed by the founding team, and will eventually transition to a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). As part of the DAO, holders of the QI token will be able to initiate proposals and vote on issues that will steer the direction of the protocol.\n\nThe total supply of QI will be 7,200,000,000 tokens, and the max supply will be projected to be fully distributed by Q1 2024. The token distribution is designed to ensure that market participants who actively engage with the platform will receive QI tokens. The majority of the tokens will be distributed through the Liquidity Mining program.\n",
  "BentoBox": "Product of SushiSwap. BentoBox is a token vault that generates yield for the liquidity deposited in it. Anyone can provide liquidity to it, and anyone can build on top of it. The first product by Sushi built on top of the BentoBox is Kashi, a lending and borrowing protocol.\n",
  "BEP-2": "A technical standard for the issuance and implementation of tokens on the Binance Chain. This standard defines a set of rules that tokens should follow to function in the Binance Chain ecosystem. A comparable token standard for issuing tokens on the Ethereum blockchain is ERC-20. BEP-2 isn't a piece of software, but rather a set of technical specifications. These rules ensure that tokens in the Binance Chain ecosystem can seamlessly interact with each other. BEP-2 tokens can represent a wide range of digital assets and tradable goods. The standard ensures that they can all smoothly integrate with each other and the surrounding ecosystem. The BEP-2 standard also defines some of the basic and most essential features of tokens issued on Binance Chain. While the standard defines the rules, different tokens will still have different implementations for the specific use cases they are created for. Still, creating a standard like this significantly decreases the amount of effort required from developers to issue tokens. The native asset of Binance Chain is BNB, which is used to pay for fees (similar to gas). This means that when you'd like to transfer your BEP-2 tokens, users also need to have a small amount of BNB in your wallet. BEP-2 tokens can be traded on Binance DEX, a decentralized exchange that's running on top of Binance Chain.\n",
  "BEP-20": "A token standard on Binance Smart Chain that extends ERC-20, the most common Ethereum token standard. You can think of it as a blueprint for tokens that defines how they can be spent, who can spend them, and other rules for their usage. Due to its similarity to Binance Chain's BEP-2 and Ethereum's ERC-20, it's compatible with both. BEP-20 was conceived as a technical specification for Binance Smart Chain, with the goal of providing a flexible format for developers to launch a range of different tokens. These could represent anything from shares in a business to dollars stored in a bank vault (i.e., a stablecoin).\n",
  "BEPSwap": "THORChain's first go-to market liquidity pool platform, and can be described as UniSwap for Binance Chain.\n",
  "Berezka DAO": "A DeFi DAO fund that has automated governance, is fully transparent (on chain), flexible and adaptive (works with any DeFi smart-contract), composable (can combine different strategies in one), sovereign (wholly owned by beneficiaries (token holders)), and has a portfolio of strategies.\n",
  "Berry Cards": "A marketplace for pixel art NFTs, which runs on the NEAR protocol, allowing people to buy artwork created with Berry Club. People buy the cards they like using NEAR, and then sell those cards again on the marketplace. However, Berry Cards has a number of features that separate it from other NFT marketplaces. For starters, owners of an NFT are not able to set a price for their work; instead, Berry Cards does it for them, using a number of methods. An individual pixel art (AKA a Berry Card) first gets its value by people voting on which art they prefer. Everybody with a NEAR wallet is able to sign into Berry Cards and begin voting on which cards they prefer. By going to the homepage, a user will be presented with two random cards and will be prompted to pick the one they like best. The card they choose will then increase in value by 10%, while the other card will lose value by 10%. This is a simple and elegant way of creating fair prices for NFTs as it reflects what the community as a whole considers most valuable, rather than one person. It is \"voting with your wallet\" in the most literal sense.\n\nBerry Cards are not made by one individual person, but rather they are designed by a community of people all working together. Berry Club users collaborate on individual cards by organizing themselves using individual chatrooms, where they discuss what changes they would like to work on together, and what designs they would like to make. This encourages a sense of unity among users. It also makes Berry Cards more special, as it means that multiple people have worked on them, and will continue to work on them indefinitely. This is one of the reasons why no individual person is able to set the price for a Berry Card, because Berry Cards are community-driven, and so it would be unfair for one person to set the price, rather than letting the community itself set the price.\n\nPeople are able to add pixels to a project on Berry Club by using avocados, a token that runs on the NEAR network. When users use (or plant) these tokens onto a piece of work, they can earn a yield each day.\n",
  "Beta": "A measure of the volatility—or systematic risk—of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets (usually stocks). CAPM is widely used as a method for pricing risky securities and for generating estimates of the expected returns of assets, considering both the risk of those assets and the cost of capital.\n",
  "Beta Finance": "A permissionless money market for borrowing, lending, and shorting crypto assets. This means that anyone at anytime is able to create a money market for any crypto asset. Their mission is to offset the volatility in DeFi today by developing critical infrastructure and user tooling to facilitate market efficiency. They stand by the DeFi ethos of \"Open Finance For All\" and seek to re-define finance by providing a foundational block in DeFi that future projects will be built upon.\n",
  "Betoken": "An open source, crowd-powered, crypto asset management protocol connecting capital and talent. Many people have the capital to invest in cryptocurrency but not the expertise, and many others have the expertise but not the capital. The protocol connects capital to talent and vice versa. Your capital is automatically distributed among Betoken’s community of managers. The best of them will have the most influence over how that capital is put to work. Unlike platforms such as Melonport and eToro, you don’t need to waste time on choosing the best performers and carefully hedging capital amongst them. All Betoken managers actively trade against the market while you sleep. The Betoken protocol recognizes and quantifies the talent of its crypto-traders by allocating units of reputation to them, denominated in Kairo tokens, and financially rewards them based on their talent and contributions.\n",
  "Betoken Share Token": "When you connect your capital to Betoken, your deposit is converted in Betoken Share tokens (BTKS). It represents your ownership in the Betoken fund and is fully backed by a collateral in the smart contract. Each of them acts like a tokenized portfolio, containing the underlying tokens that Betoken managers buy and sell.\n",

Bidesk also provide 24/7 customer support service which is always on hand to help, users are made certain of prompt response for any issue. The exchange will list both digital assets that are known for having consistent liquidity and exciting smaller projects for which there is current demand for, but they are not yet available on a polished platform like Bidesk. The team believes the community, and the users, have to be viewed as an essential priority. Therefore, we strive to be a community-centric exchange, delivering a high class service to all our customers, on our journey to become a brand name that people recognize, and trust, in the cryptocurrency sector. We view blockchain as having a large part to play in the future. Therefore, we will work towards the cryptocurrency space gaining mass adoption. One step towards this goal is supporting new and upcoming projects in their launch.\n",
  "Bidesk Token": "Native token of Bidesk. The total supply is 100 million which will never be increased. BDK token is a decentralized blockchain digital asset issued by Ethereum, based on the ERC20 standard token of Ethereum blockchain. Holders of the BDK token will enjoy multiple benefits and privileges. BDK will serve as an important medium of exchange for the entire Bidesk ecosystem. The usage scenarios of BDK will continue to evolve with the development of Bidesk's business and functions. BDK's specific usage scenarios are, but not limited to, the following: Allocation in IEO's, discount in trading fee, airdrop reward. Token supply and price appreciation/depreciation has a direct relationship. Therefore, we will reduce token supply to achieve scarcity and higher token value. This reduction will be achieved by buying back tokens from the secondary market, and then burned. To maintain a transparent relationship with our customers, all buy-back records will be made public.\n",
  "BIFI Token": "The native governance token of Beefy Finance. By holding this token and staking as part of their governance mechanisms, users can directly take part in the decision-making process. To get their hands on the token, head to one of the many liquidity pools or exchanges on the Binance Smart Chain such as 1inch or PancakeSwap.\n\nInbuilt within the tokenomics of the platform are mechanisms to bring its deflationary nature. This rewards early supporters and has the aim of creating highly incentivized token holders to contribute to the project. After an initial distribution period of around two months, 72,000 tokens were supplied to the community with 8,000 locked for the founding team.\n\nToken holders of $BIFI have a right to create and vote on proposals to the platform as part of its governance system. Tokens can be staked in the governance pool to gain rewards also in wBNB. A portion of the fees paid by our yield farming vault users is then distributed to holders of the $BIFI token staked in the pool. \n\nUsers do not need to un-stake their tokens to participate in the voting process. This incentivizes much more voter participation as it means users don't need to default their rewards to vote.\n\nBIFI can also be staked in the BIFI max vault, which pays out rewards in $BIFI. wBNB from vault fees are used to purchase $BIFI from the open market as the token is non-inflationary and will no longer mint any more tokens. These purchased tokens are then distributed to anyone who has staked in the BIFI max vault.\n",

  "Binance Chain": "A blockchain project initiated by Binance. The initial focus was to develop the blockchain to handle load/transactions. Additional features will be introduced over time.\n",
  "Binance Coin": "The cryptocurrency issued by Binance Exchange and trades with the BNB symbol. Binance coin initially ran on the Ethereum blockchain with the ERC-20 standard but has since become the native coin of the Binance chain. Binance coin has a strict maximum of 200 million BNB tokens. Every quarter, Binance uses one-fifth of its profits to repurchase and permanently destroy, or \"burn,\" Binance coins held in its treasury. BNB was created as a utility token for discounted trading fees in 2017, but its uses have expanded to numerous applications, including payments for transaction fees (on the Binance Chain), travel bookings, entertainment, online services, and financial services.\n",
  "Binance Community Vote": "Term that refers to the community having the opportunity to vote for their favourite project to win a free listing on Binance.\n",

It uses a Staking-based consensus and governance system. There is native cross-communication support for Binance Chain with Binance Smart Chain.\n",
  "Binance Smart Chain Explorer": "Block Explorer for the Binance Smart Chain.\n",
  "Binance USD": "Binance USD (BUSD) is a 1:1 USD-backed stablecoin approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), issued in partnership with Paxos.\n",
  "Binary Coin Days Destroyed": "A derivative of the Supply-Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric. It considers whether the volume of coin days destroyed over the period of interest was more, or less, than the long-term historical average. This provides a view as to whether the spending behaviour of large volumes and/or old coins is significant relative to historical data.\n\nBinary CDD will return either a 1 or a 0:\n Returns 1: when measured Supply-Adjusted CDD is greater than the long term average.\n Returns 0: when measured Supply-Adjusted CDD is less than the long term average.\n\nBinary CDD is particularly useful when a value of 1 or 0 trends consistently for extended periods of time as it suggests a trend of longer term holding (trend of 0) or increased spending (consistent 1).\n\nCoined by Hans Hauge (May 2019)\n",
  "BIND Token": "Compendia's native cryptocurrency. BIND represents Vote Power (or Power) on the network (1 BIND = 1 Power). With Vote Power, you can vote for validators (the miners of the network). The top forty-seven validators on the network with the most votes mine blocks, which means they verify transactions and earn block rewards and transaction fees in return. Validators also have the ability to upload databases to Compendia. These databases can then be used by apps and services for free. The apps using these databases can rank their items by measuring the vote power of the validator that uploaded it. Therefore, BIND not only influences forging positions of validators, but also database item positions. BIND is not spent on voting (apart from a small transaction fee when setting a vote). Instead, the voting power of a Compendia wallet consists of the total sum of its BIND balance and stake.\n",
  "BIOS Token": "$BIOS token is utilized in the 0x_nodes ecosystem as a self refilling reward token that collects protocol fees through an enhanced yield aggregation algorithm. Being necessary for both internal and external transactions, $BIOS token unlocks the full functionality of the 0x_nodes Kernel. It is used for automatic liquidity balancing, governance, rewards, system feature unlocks, bidirectional cross-chain yield aggregration, and chain agnostic protocol fee.\n",
  "BIP 32": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32 (BIP 32) established the standard for hierarchical-deterministic (HD) wallets, a technical improvement over earlier wallets that on random key pairs. BIP 32 allowed for the creation of a hierarchical tree-like wallet structure with more advanced cryptographic security mechanisms. HD wallets are defined by a master key pair at the top of the hierarchy that “determines” all the private key and key pair access codes below it in the access hierarchy.\n",
  "BIP 38 Password": "A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 38 (BIP 38) password enables walletholders to encrypt Bitcoin private keys to offer an extra layer of protection. An encrypted private key requires that a user hold both the private key and the password in order to access wallet funds. This makes private key management a critically important step, which is commonly done on paper wallets and other analog devices for security purposes.\n",
  "BIP 39": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 39 (BIP 39) allows for the generation of a human-readable 12-24 word recovery phrase for hierarchical-deterministic (HD) wallets. With the recovery phrase, users can regenerate an HD wallet that has become lost or damaged. Because they hold such access, BIP39-enabled recovery phrases should be kept secret and stored securely.\n",
  "BIP 44": "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 44 (BIP 44) improves on BIP 32’s HD wallet structure by creating a specific hierarchy that allows for multiple accounts to be held on the same wallet. BIP 44 allowed two or more separate accounts on the same wallet to hold the same cryptocurrencies in different amounts. The separate accounts could be used for different purposes and coexist in a way similar to checking, business, and savings accounts at legacy banks.\n",
  "BISHOP Token": "Token on Tranchess. Users can think of BISHOP token as a USDC yielding product. BISHOP token holders collect interest at a certain interest rate that changes every week. Every week, the protocol reads the USDC interest rate from Venus and adds a premium determined by community voting to the rate. The total becomes BISHOP's next week's fixed interest rate.\n",
  "Bisq": "An open-source, peer-to-peer desktop application that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies privately and securely. No registration is required. Bisq never holds user funds. Deposits held in 2-of-2 multisig wallets encourage safe, successful trades. User data is stored locally on-disk, and is never sent to a central server. Every Bisq node is a Tor hidden service by default.\n",
  "BitClout": "A new type of social network that lets users speculate on people and posts with real money. It is built from the ground up as its own custom blockchain. Its architecture is similar to Bitcoin, only that it can support complex social network data like posts, profiles, follows, speculation features, and much more at significantly higher throughput and scale. Like Bitcoin, BitClout is a fully open-source project and there is no company behind it--it's just coins and code.\n",
  "Bitcoin": "A cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto and started in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software. It is a decentralized digital currency without a central bank or single administrator that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries. Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services.\n",
  "Bitcoin ATM": "A kiosk that allows a person to purchase Bitcoin by using cash or debit card. Some Bitcoin ATMs offer bi-directional functionality enabling both the purchase of Bitcoin as well as the sale of Bitcoin for cash. In some cases, Bitcoin ATM providers require users to have an existing account to transact on the machine. There are two main types of Bitcoin machines: unidirectional (one-way) and bidirectional (two-way). Only about 30% of all crypto ATMs worldwide are bidirectional, and less than 23% in the U.S. Both types are connected to the Internet, allowing for cash purchase and/or sale of Bitcoin. Some machines use a paper receipt and others move money to a public key on the blockchain. Bitcoin cash kiosks look like traditional ATMs, but do not connect to a bank account and instead connect the user directly to a Bitcoin wallet or exchange. While some Bitcoin ATMs are traditional ATMs with revamped software, they do not require a bank account or debit card. According to an advisory issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, \"they may also charge high transaction fees – media reports describe transaction fees as high as 7% and exchange rates $50 over rates you could get elsewhere\".\n",
  "Bitcoin Cash": "A cryptocurrency created in August 2017, from a fork of Bitcoin. Bitcoin Cash increases the size of blocks, allowing more transactions to be processed. Bitcoin Cash also differs from Bitcoin in another respect. Bitcoin Cash does not incorporate Segregated Witness (SegWit), another solution proposed to accommodate more transactions per block. SegWit retains only information or the metadata relating to a transaction in a block. Typically, all details pertaining to a transaction are stored in a block. The cryptocurrency underwent another fork in November 2018 and split into Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash SV (Satoshi Vision). Bitcoin Cash is referred to as Bitcoin Cash because it uses the original Bitcoin Cash client. \n",
  "Bitcoin Core": "The leading implementation of the software enabling users to interact with the Bitcoin network. It is not owned by any single business or organization but is instead updated and reviewed by a community of worldwide developers. The software was initially released by Satoshi Nakamoto (under the name Bitcoin), only to be later renamed to Bitcoin Core to avoid any confusion.\n\nBy running the Bitcoin Core code, a user effectively acts as a node on the network. They can independently verify the validity of blocks received, as well as transactions sent by other users. This keeps miners in check and means that the user needs not trust anyone (such as a wallet provider) to display the correct view of the blockchain. Bundled into the software is a wallet. Users can use this directly from within the application, or tether external wallets to their node to validate received transactions.\n",
  "Bitcoin Dominance": "The ratio between the market cap of Bitcoin to the rest of the cryptocurrency markets. For many years, while Bitcoin was far and away the largest cryptocurrency - and one of the few in existence - its dominance was much closer to 100% than it is today. However, the Bitcoin dominance dropped significantly as new cryptocurrencies were created. This is probably related to the increased popularity of ICOs after the introduction of Ethereum and the ERC-20 token standard. Interestingly, Bitcoin dominance is often affected by the so-called \"alt seasons\", in which altcoins gain market share relative to Bitcoin, thus reducing Bitcoin's dominance. Note, however, that Bitcoin dominance is not always directly affected by bull or bear markets because it is a ratio, not an absolute term. This means that if Bitcoin falls in price, but the rest of the cryptocurrency market falls at a similar rate, then Bitcoin dominance is likely to remain the same.\n",
  "Bitcoin Improvement Proposal": "A technical design document providing information to the Bitcoin community, describing new proposed features, processes or environments affecting the Bitcoin protocol.

  "Bitcoin Pizza": "The name given to the first known purchase of physical goods with bitcoin.\n\nOn May 22nd, 2010, a programmer named Laszlo Hanyecz made a post on Bitcointalk, the only Bitcoin forum in existence at that point. Hanyecz wrote: \n\nI’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. Like maybe 2 large ones so i have some left over for the next day\n\nAt the time, 10,000 BTC was equivalent to approximately 41 USD. This equals to a Bitcoin price of about 0.0041 USD. Hanyecz's offer was taken up by another Bitcointalk user, who paid 25 USD for the two pizzas, netting a whopping 16 USD profit even at the time!\n",

It will be made available as a divisible token, allowing for granular pricing.\n\nDue to expected volume, direct use of the public TRON blockchain for all transactions is unfeasible. Therefore, BitTorrent Inc. will deploy an \"on-chain/off-chain exchange.\" The exchange will enable the transfer of tokens between a high-performance private ledger and the public TRON blockchain.\n",
  "Black Boys Code": "An initiative to  inspire young men of colour to find their confidence and realize they have the ability to take on any challenge.

We show them how to be leaders.\n",
  "Black Swan Event": "An unpredictable event that is beyond what is normally expected of a situation and has potentially severe consequences. Black swan events are characterized by their extreme rarity, severe impact, and the widespread insistence they were obvious in hindsight. Black swan events can cause catastrophic damage to an economy by negatively impacting markets and investments, but even the use of robust modeling cannot prevent a black swan event. Reliance on standard forecasting tools can both fail to predict and potentially increase vulnerability to black swans by propagating risk and offering false security.\n",
  "BlackHoleSwap": "A decentralized AMM (Automatic Market Making) exchange designed for stablecoins. By integrating lending protocols to leverage the excess supply while borrowing on the inadequate side, it can therefore process transactions far exceeding its existing liquidity. Compared to other AMMs, BlackHoleSwap provides nearly infinite liquidity with the lowest price slippage, maximizing capital utilization. A product of Hakka Finance.\n",

BLY Token can be used as means of all transactions and contracts, including data provision, payment for data usage, dispute mediation, and guarantees for contract fulfilment, within the Blocery ecosystem.\n",
  "Block": "A batch of valid transactions that are hashed and encoded into a Merkle tree. Each block includes the cryptographic hash of the prior block in the blockchain, linking the two. The linked blocks form a chain. This iterative process confirms the integrity of the previous block, all the way back to the original genesis block.\n",
  "Block Explorer": "A Block Explorer allows users to explore and search a Blockchain for transactions, addresses, prices, and other activities taking place on that particular blockchain.\n",
  "Block Gas Limit": "The block gas limit is Ethereum’s way of ensuring blocks don’t grow too large. It simply means that blocks are limited in the amount of gas the transactions contained in them can consume. Put simply, if a transaction consumes too much gas it will never fit in a block and, therefore, will never be executed. This can lead to a vulnerability that we come across quite frequently: If data is stored in variable-sized arrays and then accessed via loops over these arrays, the transaction may simply run out of gas and be reverted. This happens when the number of elements in the array grows large, so usually in production, rather than in testing. The fact that test data is often smaller makes this issue so dangerous since contracts with this issue usually pass unit tests and seem to work well with a small number of users. However, they fail just when a project gains momentum and the amount of data increases. It is not uncommon to end up with unretrievable funds if the loops are used to push out payments.\n",
  "Block Header": "A section in a block that serves as a summary of the rest of the block. It's made up of all the metadata – such as the time and difficulty when the block was mined, the Merkle root of the included transactions, and the nonce. Also present is the previous block's hash, which is what allows us to create the \"chain\" of blocks. In essence, the block header contains any data that isn't the list of raw transactions itself.\n\nA block header is what the miners hash to try and make the block valid. This is a lot more efficient than hashing the entirety of the block, which can be made up of thousands of transactions. It would be vastly more cumbersome for a miner to change the nonce and to rehash a whole 2MB block for every attempt. Compare this with hashing Bitcoin's block headers, for instance, which have a fixed length of 80 bytes.\n\nBlock headers are great from a mining point of view, but because of their small size, they’re also ideal for light clients. The Bitcoin blockchain is too large for devices like smartphones to store. If the chain had 100,000 1MB blocks, you’d consume 100GB of space. But with just the block headers for those same blocks, you’d only take up 0.008GB, or 8MB.\n\nIn this way, devices with less bandwidth or storage space can still perform some degree of validation. Because the Merkle root encapsulates all of the transactions, they can later check whether a transaction was included in a particular block. This does come at a cost – the user must still rely on a third party to provide them with necessary information. With that said, light clients are preferable to a system where the users perform no verification at all.\n",
  "Block Height": "The number of blocks preceding the block in question on the blockchain, or can be thought of as total blocks in the chain before this point.\n",
  "Block Lattice": "A block lattice is a novel type of DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) based architecture that was first introduced by the Nano cryptocurrency. With this type of architecture, each individual transacting on the network possesses their own blockchain, which is controlled by the individual’s private keys. The block lattice architecture is designed to be an improvement upon the current blockchain model that is currently being used by cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. The block lattice accomplishes this by allowing for faster transaction times than are currently being achieved with blockchain models.\n",
  "Block Reward": "An incentive for a miner who successfully calculates a valid hash in a block during mining. By contributing to the security and liveness of the chain, the miner is rewarded with this incentive, ensuring that miners continue to act in the best interest of the blockchain by legitimately taking part in the process (instead of hacking it).\n",
  "Block Size": "A block can be thought of as a bundle of transactions, with each transaction needing to be validated before it can be accepted by the network. Each block has what is known as a block size. The block size is simply the maximum limit a block can be filled up with transactions. For example, the Bitcoin block size currently stands at 1 MB. Miners can choose how much of a block to fill with transactions. However, if a block that exceeds the block size limit is submitted, it will be rejected by the network. The intention of a block size is to prevent denial-of-service attacks on the network. If there was no block size limit, in theory, an attacker could flood the network with lots of transactions, therefore potentially bringing the network to a halt.\n",
  "Block Time": "Block time, in the context of cryptocurrency, is a measure of the time it takes to produce a new block, or data file, in a blockchain network. It is the length of time it takes to validate the existence of a new batch of bitcoins. Theoretically, each network has its own defined block time. For instance, the Bitcoin network’s block time is around 10 minutes while the Ethereum network’s block time is about 20 seconds. The reality is not that precise.\n",
  "Block Trade": "The sale or purchase of a large number of securities. A block trade involves a significantly large number of equities or bonds being traded at an arranged price between two parties. Block trades are sometimes done outside of the open markets to lessen the impact on the security's price. In general, a block trade involves at least 10,000 shares of stock, not including penny stocks, or $200,000 worth of bonds. In practice, block trades are much larger than 10,000 shares.\n",
  "BlockBank": "An AI-powered, traditional mobile banking experience with seamless crypto integration. They aim to combine the best of the DeFi and CeFi worlds in one place, incorporating AI technology to bring financial empowerment to clients in a very simplified manner.\n\nBlockBank wants to simplify the user experience without compromising compliance, security, privacy, or decentralization. The complex nature of DeFi platforms requires elegant trade execution and earning strategies to avoid high gas costs and slow speeds. They optimize multi-step DeFi purchasing processes and add a powerful AI assistant to guide their users to make intelligent and informed decisions.\n",
  "Blockchain": "A growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree). By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of its data. This is because once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks.\n\nFor use as a distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. The blockchain has been described as \"an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way\".\n\nThe blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown to date. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by cryptocurrencies. The blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private blockchains have been proposed for business use but Computerworld called the marketing of such privatized blockchains without a proper security model \"snake oil\". However, others have argued that permissioned blockchains, if carefully designed, may be more decentralized and therefore secure in practice than permissionless ones.\n",
  "Blockchain Art Exchange": "A platform for the primary sale of digital tokenized art, or as it is now known Cryptoart.

Each cutie, which is a non-fungible, can be transferred or sold to other players just like a regular cryptocurrency.\n",
  "Blockchain Gaming": "Any games that include blockchain technology in its backend or mechanics in general. The most often use for blockchain tech in games so far has been to store gamers' items on the blockchain, tying them to their (Ethereum) wallet and making them permanently their own.\n\nIn contrast to this, in \"classic\" games, any items that gamers supposedly own in-game are in fact stored on the game publisher's servers, as is their whole account. There are many ways for you to lose possession of your assets in this case - server malfunction (failure or attack), stopped game development, banned account, etc.\n\nThe first generation of blockchain games was solely based on this principle and they were focused on collecting unique assets and trading them, for fun, profit, or both. CryptoKitties was the game that started this trend and they are still quite popular. Nowadays, we see games where blockchain technology is used to store assets and confirm and store player's progress, but with an additional, more complex gameplay built around that.\n",

  "BoltDB": "The persistent key-value store database utilised by the Prysm client. A piece of software that Prysm initially inherited from its origins as a Geth fork was its storage engine, LevelDB. As a simple embedded key-value store written in Go, LevelDB worked well; however, after observing a number of corruption-related issues, it was decided to survey some other options for the project.\n\nThere were two main requirements of the new storage engine; it needed to be an embedded environment, and written in Go. After a considerable amount of testing, three options in particular met this criteria as well as performance expectancy: BoltDB, Badger and the old option, LevelDB.\n\nAfter testing and benchmarking all three options, Bolt was decided upon as the best option for Prysm. Although LevelDB and Badger performed better in write-heavy benchmarks (as expected for an LSM-tree), the difference was not substantial, while BoltDB performed much better on read-heavy benchmarks. Further, though Bolt also consumes more space on disk compared to the other two options, it provides the strongest guarantees against data loss, one of the most crucial goals of the project.\n",

  "Burn": "Cryptocurrency tokens or coins are burned when they are permanently removed from the circulating supply on purpose — as opposed to assets that are lost on accident, like by being unintentionally sent to an address with no owner or via the loss of access to the wallet where they are stored. Token burning is usually performed by the development team behind a particular cryptocurrency asset. It can be done in several ways, most commonly by sending the coins to a so-called \"eater address\": its current balance is publicly visible on the blockchain, but access to its contents is unavailable to anyone. The practice of burning may involve the project’s developers buying tokens back from the market or burning parts of the supply already available to them. Burning can be done with different goals in mind, but most often it is used for deflationary purposes: the decrease in the circulating supply tends to drive an asset's price upward, incentivizing traders and investors to get involved. Another important use case for token burning is to maintain the price peg of stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose value corresponds to another asset, like the U.S. dollar): by burning or minting new tokens as necessary, the controlling authority can influence the asset’s price to remain at a near-constant level.\n",

A burner wallet is automatically generated upon visiting xdai.io and the private key is stored in a local storage so it will be there when users come back. However, users should sweep any value they hold to a cold wallet regularly and burn their ephemeral private key. A burner wallet is analogous to cash; users won't carry too much because it can be lost but it's astonishingly easy to exchange. This can also be very handy in everyday use even for the crypto-initiated. If users share a Lyft or a pizza with a friend and want to split the cost, they can just shoot their QR code with their camera and it will open up a new burner wallet to exchange value with them.\n",

  "Call Depth Attack": "External function calls can fail any time because they exceed the maximum call stack of 1024. In such situations, Solidity throws an exception. Malicious actors might be able to force the call stack to a high value before they interact with your contract. As of the EIP 150 hardfork, call depth attacks are no longer relevant* (all gas would be consumed well before reaching the 1024 call depth limit).\n",
  "Call Option": "Financial contracts that give the option buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock, bond, commodity or other asset or instrument at a specified price within a specific time period. The stock, bond, or commodity is called the underlying asset. The specified price is known as the strike price and the specified time during which a sale is made is its expiration or time to maturity. Call options may be purchased for speculation, or sold for income purposes. They may also be combined for use in spread or combination strategies. A call buyer profits when the underlying asset increases in price. A call option may be contrasted with a put, which gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a specified price on or before expiration.\n",

The Spartan Bucket could contain the following:\n\n 6 centralised exchanges (Loss of funds policy): Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Bitfinex, Bitmex and Deribit\n 2 wallets: Ledger Hardware and Gnosis SAFE\n 8 DAPPs (Smart Contract Protection Policy): Uniswap, Compound, Melonport, Kyber, Deversifi, dYdX, MakerDAO and Paraswap\n 1 oracle (oracle failure policy): Chainlink\n 1 validator on ETH 2.0 (slashing protection policy): Lido Finance\n 3 custodians: Ledger Vault, Coinbase Custody and Bitgo\n 4 peg loss-related protections: wBTC, USDT, DAI and USDC\n\nThe Spartan Bucket has a default maximum exposure of 5% of the insurance capacity per policy, which can be adjusted by the DAO on a policy per policy base through majority vote.\n",
  "Capital Efficiency": "The measure of how much capital is used for token exchange activity on Uniswap when compared to how much capital is actually offered for trades at all the possible prices in the pool.\n\nDecentralized exchanges such as Uniswap v2 require that capital to complete a trade would be evenly placed at all possible prices, $0 to infinity.\n\nThis means that if trading happens at a very small price, say $0.99 to $1.01, there would be a large amount of Liquidity Provider capital that would sit on the exchange platform's smart contract untraded at prices such as $0.95 or at $1.50. Untraded or unused capital is inefficient because that capital is not actively being used to generate trading fees and profits.\n\nIn Uniswap v3 Liquidity Providers have more control over where they are able to place their capital. Liquidity Providers in Uniswapv 3 are able to use their capital in more flexible and narrower price ranges that was not previously possible in Uniswapv2. This means that Liquidity Providers can collect more fees for less capital. Also, for traders who want to trade or exchange their tokens, they will enjoy prices that are closer to where they want to complete their exchange.\n\nIf Alice wants to make as much profit as possible on UniswapV3, she can now set her price for exchanging tokens in a narrow range such one between $0.99 and $1.01.\n",

Cargo Credits can be purchased in packs, offering a range of options that cater to everyone from NFT novices to full-blown enterprises. Currently 1 Cargo Credit is equal to 1 NFT mint on the platform. This will not always be the case. This will change in the future as the price of minting will become dynamic - so the market can dictate the price of credits, but the cost of minting will remain constant. Currently Cargo credits are purchasable on the site and will remain so, but once they are on decentralized exchanges they will be sold on the site for the going market rate with an added convenience fee.\n",
  "Cargo Gems": "The platform utility token that functions as a governance token and future payment option on the Cargo platform. Cargo provides a unique NFT staking model which allows you to stake Cargo Gems that will generate rewards in both Gems and Cargo Credits. Through Cargo's NFT staking portal you can insert Gems directly into compatible NFTs and start earning rewards. Compatible NFTs include smart contracts that adhere to the latest ERC-721 standard. Compatibility is determined by verifying that the NFT contract adheres to the ERC-165 interface of ERC-721.

This means you will be able to transfer your NFTs to a cold wallet while still being able to earn rewards - or you could transfer the NFT to a friend who would then be able to withdraw rewards. Only the current owner of NFT will be able to withdraw Gems and claim rewards for that NFT.\n",
  "Cargo JS": "A JavaScript library that you can use to interact with Cargo through your own application.

Ownership of the smart B/L document is unequivocally transacted to the new owner, who can legally claim ownership rights.\n",
  "Carry Trade": "A trading strategy that involves borrowing at a low-interest rate and investing in an asset that provides a higher rate of return. A carry trade is typically based on borrowing in a low-interest rate currency and converting the borrowed amount into another currency. Generally, the proceeds would be deposited in the second currency if it offers a higher interest rate. The proceeds also could be deployed into assets such as stocks, commodities, bonds, or real estate that are denominated in the second currency.\n\nAlthough carry trades can contain potential financial rewards, this strategy can also pose significant risks, including: (1) The risk of a sharp decline in the price of the invested assets, and (2) The implicit exchange risk, or currency risk, when the funding currency differs from the borrower’s domestic currency.\n\nCurrency risk in a carry trade is seldom hedged because hedging would either impose an additional cost or negate the positive interest rate differential if currency forwards—or contracts that lock in the exchange rate for a time in the future—are used.\n",

  "Cash": "In the everyday meaning of the word, cash is the physical form of currency: coins and banknotes that can be carried on person and used to pay for goods and services immediately. However, in different contexts, the meaning of cash can expand to include bank accounts and marketable securities such as government bonds. Even less narrowly, in finance, cash includes all currency equivalents that can be liquidated immediately or near-immediately. Historically, gold and silver coins were for a long time an almost exclusive means of payment across the globe: the scarcity of precious metals ensured their value and their uniformity allowed for simpler accounting. The emergence of paper money from seventh century CE onwards has led to the gradual detachment of the value of cash from the value of the material it is made of and the ultimate appearance of fiat currencies — like the U.S. dollar and the euro. These are established as money by the decision of the government and have no intrinsic value. From the 1980s on, societies across the globe have been increasingly moving away from cash, replacing it with debit and credit cards and, more recently, mobile payments. As of November 2020, the global volume of cash comprises roughly $6.6 trillion — just a fraction of $630 trillion to $1.2 quadrillion, which is the total volume of all types of money.\n",

CashShuffle is a version of CoinJoin that works on the Bitcoin Cash protocol.\n",
  "Casper": "Casper is the implementation that will eventually convert Ethereum into a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain (also known as Ethereum 2.0). Although Ethereum was launched in the summer of 2015 as a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, developers were already planning a long-term transition to the staking model. After the transition is complete, mining will no longer be part of the Ethereum network. To date, there have been two co-developed Casper implementations in the Ethereum ecosystem: Casper CBC (Correct-by-Construction) and Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget). The CBC version was initially proposed by Ethereum Foundation researcher Vlad Zamfir. Although research on CBC was initially focused on PoS protocols for public blockchains, it has since evolved into a wider field of study, comprising a family of PoS models. Research on Casper FFG is being led by Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. The initial proposal consisted of a hybrid PoW/PoS system, but the implementation is still under discussion, and new proposals may eventually replace it with a pure PoS model.\n",

  "Centaur": "A protocol that utilizes a semi-decentralised approach to constructing solutions, leveraging on the transparency and security of decentralised architectures while providing a fail-safe layer through centralised systems and processes. For example, in lending, the decentralized method is to for lenders to stake their funds into Centaur liquidity pools and borrowers can take out loans against those funds after a simple KYC process. The centralized method is that in the event of a borrower default, Centaur will claw back the funds through traditional judicial processes and dispute resolutions methods.\n",
  "Central Bank": "A central bank, reserve bank, or monetary authority is an institution that manages the currency and monetary policy of a state or formal monetary union, and oversees their commercial banking system. In contrast to a commercial bank, a central bank possesses a monopoly on increasing the monetary base. Most central banks also have supervisory and regulatory powers to ensure the stability of member institutions, to prevent bank runs, and to discourage reckless or fraudulent behavior by member banks.\n\nCentral banks in most developed nations are institutionally independent from political interference. Still, limited control by the executive and legislative bodies exists.\n",
  "Central Bank Digital Currency ": "Term that refers to fiat currencies that exist in a digital form and are issued by central banks. Central bank digital currencies (CBDC's) remain fully within the orbit of the traditional, intermediated financial system of fiat currencies, which are backed by trust in the currency's issuer: a national central bank and ultimately, the sovereign government or political authority behind it. They are a concept inspired by — but different from — true cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) or Ethereum (ETH). CBDCs are fiat currencies like the U.S. dollar, euro or the Japanese yen, as they are issued by central banks of their respective nations in a digital form. As of November 2020, there are no publicly available CBDC implementations — instead, they only exist in the form of proof-of-concept projects, like the Digital Currency/Electronic Payments of the People's Bank of China, or the digital Uruguayan peso of the central bank of Uruguay. CBDCs may or may not employ a distributed database like the blockchain; however, they cannot be considered true cryptocurrencies. They are not decentralized due to the fact that their issuing central banks maintain complete control over CBDC production and distribution — in the same way as they do with traditional fiat currencies. Their value is also not backed by anything other than the public's trust in the issuer. CBDCs do, however, offer several advantages over other forms of fiat money, such as the ability to send them directly between two parties without having to rely on third-party payment processors. CBDCs also offer more immediate control by the government over its currency, resulting in more efficient implementation of monetary policy.\n",
  "Central Ledger": "Physical books or digital files used by individuals or organizations to record and total economic transactions in a centralized manner — as opposed to decentralized ledgers used in distributed ledger technology (DLT). Ledgers have been used since the earliest days of civilization to record and confirm the ownership of assets and the legal identity of individuals, as well as their legal status and political rights. The popularization of double-entry bookkeeping in 16th century Italy has revolutionized the use of ledgers in banking and accounting, which played a crucial role in expanding the capitalist economic system, according to some experts. The technique of recording every entry to an account along with a corresponding and opposite entry in a different account has significantly improved the accuracy of ledger records. Traditionally, a central ledger is managed by the accounting department of a business to record all economic activity that the company is involved in for the purpose of financial analysis, tax reporting and more. Although efficient, this approach has disadvantages: relying on a central authority to manage all bookkeeping makes the ledger vulnerable to any mistakes made by that authority — either deliberate or accidental. Distributed ledger technology is a more recent evolution of the concept of ledgers that aims to decentralize the process of bookkeeping and remove the central authority which acts as a single point of failure. Bitcoin’s (BTC) blockchain is one of the most successful examples of a decentralized ledger.\n",

  "Child Pays For Parent": "Sometimes a bitcoin transaction takes longer than usual to be confirmed. This is often due to having a low miner fee.\n\nBitcoin's Child Pays For Parent (CPFP) means that the child transaction is paying and compensating for the parent transaction so that both can be confirmed soon.\n\nIt can be thought of as a parent having insufficient money for their expenses, and then their child pays the difference on the parent's behalf.\n\nIn other words, CPFP is a technique through which users can unstick their slowly confirming incoming transactions by making a new transaction with higher fees (child transaction) using the outputs (funds) from the previous transaction (parent transaction) that is stuck.\n\nAdditionally, the miners mine only those transactions that have high or at least the minimum required fees. Therefore, they will naturally be tempted to pick the child transaction but the child transaction itself wouldn't be valid until the parent transaction is confirmed, so they must confirm both.\n\nThis mechanism of bitcoin transactions incentivizes miners to look at both of the transactions collectively and confirm the parent transaction first so that they can collect higher fees attached to the child transaction.\n\nIt is important to know that users can only accelerate incoming transactions that: \n\n Remain unconfirmed after four hours of being broadcast.\n All inputs are confirmed.\n",

  "Circulating Supply": "A term that refers to the number of cryptocurrency coins or tokens that are publicly available and circulating in the market. The circulating supply of a cryptocurrency can increase or decrease over time. For example, the circulating supply of Bitcoin will gradually increase until the max supply of 21 million coins is reached. Such a gradual increase is related to the process of mining that generates new coins every 10 minutes, on average. Alternatively, coin burn events like the ones performed by Binance, cause a decrease in the circulating supply, permanently removing coins from the market. The circulating supply refers to the coins that are accessible to the public and should not be confused with the total supply or max supply. The total supply is used to quantify the number of coins in existence, i.e., the number of coins that were already issued minus the coins that were burned. The total supply is basically the sum of the circulating supply and the coins that are locked up in escrow. On the other hand, the max supply quantifies the maximum amount of coins that will ever exist, including the coins that will be mined or made available in the future. Moreover, the circulating supply of a cryptocurrency can be used for calculating its market capitalization, which is generated by multiplying the current market price with the number of coins in circulation. So if a certain cryptocurrency has a circulating supply of 1,000,000 coins, which are being traded at $5.00 each, the market cap would be equal to $5,000,000.\n",

Equity represents partial ownership of the company, and offering ownership is a way to incentivize employees—to encourage them to stay and to perform well. However, a company is unlikely to give an employee stock until they have earned it. And that takes time.\n\nAn employee is considered \"vested\" in an employer benefit plan, once they have earned the right to receive benefits from that plan. Cliff vesting is when an employee becomes fully vested on a specified date rather than becoming partially vested in increasing amounts over an extended period.\n\nTypically, plans have a four-year vesting schedule plan with a one-year cliff. Upon completing the cliff period, the employee receives full benefits. Other plans might release benefit amounts over another scheduled period.\n",
  "Close": "A reference to the end of a trading session in the financial markets when the markets close for the day. The close can also refer to the process of exiting a trade or the final procedure in a financial transaction in which contract documents are signed and recorded.\n",
  "Closed Loop Payment Network": "Closed loop payment networks are those in which a consumer loads money into an account that can only be used with specific merchants, whereas open loop payment networks allow consumers to use money stored in a centralized wallet for multiple merchants. Closed loop networks cut out several middlemen in a payments transaction, reducing transactions fees and speeding up settlement. Flexa utilizes a closed loop payment network architecture.\n",
  "Cloud Computing": "The on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.\n\nClouds may be limited to a single organization (enterprise clouds), or be available to multiple organizations (public cloud).\n\nCloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale.\n\nAdvocates of public and hybrid clouds note that cloud computing allows companies to avoid or minimize up-front IT infrastructure costs. Proponents also claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster, with improved manageability and less maintenance, and that it enables IT teams to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable demand, providing the burst computing capability: high computing power at certain periods of peak demand.\n\nCloud providers typically use a \"pay-as-you-go\" model, which can lead to unexpected operating expenses if administrators are not familiarized with cloud-pricing models.\n\nThe availability of high-capacity networks, low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization, service-oriented architecture and autonomic and utility computing has led to growth in cloud computing. By 2019, Linux was the most widely used operating system, including in Microsoft's offerings and is thus described as dominant. The Cloud Service Provider (CSP) will screen, keep up and gather data about the firewalls, intrusion identification or/and counteractive action frameworks and information stream inside the network.\n",

The Clover network will attempt to meme itself into reality by trying to create a blackhole of liquidity. A strictly scarce token that is locked up or burnt in all future game contracts. As new projects emerge that want /biz/ exposure, they will airdrop to the existing Clover holder set for free publicity comparable to the UNI airdrop or OMG airdrop in 2017. Dev plans to make new game-theory tokens airdropped to Clover holders by main dev and others (think PoWH or FOMO3D but with Clover tokens and/or profits being airdropped to CLV uniswap liquidity providers). New Financial games/experiments within /biz/ for immediate exposure (think shrimp.finance airdropped to Clover holders). Clover will be the base token for future game theory tokens/meme defi/yield farm games played within /biz/ for fun. The ability to earn untradeable points when you stake CLV in specific pools (opportunity cost now as a game mechanic) with points being spent on unique low supply /biz/ NFT's and game pieces. Oldfags that stake for longer will provably be oldfags since points cannot be bought. If this takes off, /biz/ members may be incentivized to hold a few Clovers for fun and to show they have skin in the game for the board, with the ability to influence votes within the community.\n",

  "Cobb-Douglas Function": "A function that has many applications in economics; from being a well-behaved preference in microeconomics to a production function in macroeconomics. It is named after Paul Douglas, an American Congressmen who was researching labour and capital shares and asked Charles Cobb, a mathematician, for help in formulating this into a function.\n\nA Cobb-Douglas (CD) Function takes the form of Q=KαLβ where Q=output, K=capital, L=labour, and alpha and beta are used to represent input shares of capital and labour respectively. In this form, CD is used as a production function. If values are given for for K,α,L,β (the independent variables) then it is possible to calculate a value for output, the dependent variable. Note: sometimes Y is used instead of Q, this effectively the same thing since in economics output has to equal input so Q and Y can be used interchangeably.\n",

  "Code Injection via delegatecall": "There exists a special variant of a message call, named delegatecall which is identical to a message call apart from the fact that the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract and msg.sender and msg.value do not change their values. This allows a smart contract to dynamically load code from a different address at runtime. Storage, current address and balance still refer to the calling contract. Calling into untrusted contracts is very dangerous, as the code at the target address can change any storage values of the caller and has full control over the caller's balance. Use delegatecall with caution and make sure to never call into untrusted contracts. If the target address is derived from user input ensure to check it against a whitelist of trusted contracts.\n",

  "Coil": "To understand Coil you need to know a little about Web Monetization. ‌In a nutshell, Web Monetization is an open technology that allows someone viewing a webpage to stream very small payments (micropayments) to the page's creator in real time. Coil doesn't own Web Monetization, we just use it. For you to stream payments to a creator, you must become a Coil Member and install our extension. Your membership fee goes toward paying the creators you visit. Our extension finds the creator's payment address and streams payments on your behalf for as long as you are active on the page. As a creator, how to go about monetizing your content depends on the type of content you're working with. First, you'll need an account with a supported digital wallet provider to monetize everything except a Twitch stream. The wallet provider assigns you a payment address, called a payment pointer. Without a payment pointer, we won't know where to send your payments. The second step for most creators is to sign up for a free Coil creator account. As part of signing up, you're asked for the payment pointer your wallet provider gave you. You don't need multiple payment pointers to monetize multiple things. \n",

  "Coin Days Destroyed": "A measure of economic activity which gives more weight to coins which haven't been spent for a long time. It is considered an important alternative to looking at total transaction volumes, which may not accurately represent economic activity if value was not stored for a meaningful time. Conversely, coins held in cold storage as a long term store of value are considered economically important when they are spent as it signals a notable change in long-term holder behaviour. Every day one coin unit remains unspent, it accumulates one \"coin day\". When that coin is eventually spent, the accumulated coin days are reset to zero, or \"destroyed\" and registered by the Coin Days Destroyed (CDD) metric. The aggregate number of coin days destroyed (CDD indicator value) in a given period of time is a function of the number of coins spent multiplied by the lifespan of those coins. Since the CDD metric captures both coin lifespan and coin volume, it is a valuable tool for observing the spending behaviour of entities classified as smart money, whales and long term investors. Created by Bitcoin Forum user ByteCoin (April 2011).\n",

  "Coincidence of Wants": "Coincidence of Wants (CoWs) can be explained as \"an economic phenomenon where two parties each hold an item the other wants, so they exchange these items directly.\" CowSwap facilitates CoWs among traders and their orders through using batch auctions as a core mechanism. This means, on CowSwap, when two traders each hold an asset the other wants, a trade can be settled directly between them without an external market maker or liquidity provider. This leads to better prices for the individual traders (because traditionally market makers add a fee — referred to as spread — for their surface). CowSwap allows for coincidence of wants (CoWs) orders to be traded directly against one another. Only the excess order amount that cannot be settled directly with other CowSwap traders are sent to the underlying AMMs (automated market makers).\n",

  "Collateralized Debt Position": "The position created by locking collateral in MakerDAO's smart contract to generate its decentralized stablecoin, DAI. This system was introduced to the decentralized finance world by the MakerDAO team and is how its decentralized stablecoin DAI is created. The value of the collateral locked in a CDP needs always to exceed 150% of the value of DAI that it was used to generate. If a position becomes undercollateralized, the assets locked in the smart contract get sold to pay back for the DAI generated, a liquidation penalty and the stability fees. The generated DAI is basically a decentralized loan backed by the value of the collateral; in order to unlock the collateral, a user needs to pay back the DAI generated plus the stability fees. Each of the DAI stablecoins in circulation has been created this way. Traditionally, only Ether could be used to fund MakerDAO's CDPs, but now BAT, USDC, WBTC, TUSD, KNC, ZRX and MANA are also supported. A decentralized stablecoin backed by Ether-only is still available and is called SAI. While MakerDAO introduced CDPs, technically other DeFi projects could adopt CDPs both as a term and a system in the future.\n",
  "Collateralized Mortgage Obligation": "A type of mortgage-backed security that contains a pool of mortgages bundled together and sold as an investment. Organized by maturity and level of risk, CMOs receive cash flows as borrowers repay the mortgages that act as collateral on these securities. In turn, CMOs distribute principal and interest payments to their investors based on predetermined rules and agreements.\n\nCollateralized mortgage obligations consist of several tranches, or groups of mortgages, organized by their risk profiles. As complex financial instruments, tranches typically have different principal balances, interest rates, maturity dates, and potential of repayment defaults. Collateralized mortgage obligations are sensitive to interest rate changes as well as to changes in economic conditions, such as foreclosure rates, refinance rates, and the rates at which properties are sold. Each tranche has a different maturity date and size and bonds with monthly coupons are issued against it. The coupon makes monthly principal and interest rate payments.\n",
  "Collators": "Collators are full nodes on the Polkadot Network that are present both on parachains and the main Relay Chain.

  "Colocation": "Term referring to the establishment of a shared facility to store IT equipment and specialized hardware of multiple individuals or companies.\n\nIn high-frequency trading (HFT), colocation refers to a dedicated space within a data center belonging to stock exchanges. Its primary purpose is to locate computers owned by HFT traders and firms in the same building as the stock exchange servers.\n\nBy doing so, the HFT companies and traders are able to receive current market prices earlier than the rest of the public. Although the difference is in the order of nanoseconds, HFT firms often pay millions of dollars for such an advantage.\n\nIn other words, the high-frequency traders use colocation to gain an advantage with the physical proximity between their computers and the stock exchange servers.\n\nThe concept of colocation gained traction in the past decade, giving birth to a new kind of business. Some say that the growing demand for colocation services explains why stock traders are creating bigger data centers close to major stock exchange servers. \n\nFor instance, the previous New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) facility was domiciled in a space of approximately 4600sq feet. However, the new data center occupies a space of about 39800sq feet, making it nine times larger than the previous one.\n\nBesides the trading environment, the term colocation may also refer to specialized colocation centers (also known as carrier hotels). These are data centers that rent space, professional hardware, bandwidth, and other IT services. Such a specialized service is offered not only to other companies but also to individual customers. \n\nThese data centers offer cages, open racks, and private suites for institutions that require advanced security features. Finally, colocation is an excellent option for smaller firms as it provides them with the necessary infrastructure without the need to build everything from scratch.\n",

  "Compendia": "A decentralized network where anyone can create and contribute to open databases of any category (e.g. apps, markets, cryptocurrencies, music, videos, games, etc). Apps and services can pull data from these databases for free. In the future, Ethereum smart contracts can also use this data (e.g. for DeFi applications). Think of Compendia as an oracle network, but instead of serving one piece of simple data for one specific topic, the network can serve full data collections from many sources relating to any topic. You can also think of Compendia as the Wikipedia of databases for apps, services, blockchains, smart contracts, IoT, A.I. and more.\n",
  "Complex System": "A system where the behavior of the whole within a given environment cannot be understood directly by understanding the behavior of the parts and the environment as separate additive entities. Rather, the system’s behavior is deeply dependent on the relations among the parts. Systems that are “complex” have distinct properties that arise from these relationships, including: (1) Non-linearity: the output of a complex system is greater than the sum of its parts; (2) Emergence: the behavior of a complex system cannot be understood simply by looking at its components; (3) Spontaneous order: the apparent chaos of a complex system produces order or stability without outside imposition; (4) Adaptation: systemic behavior alters when it alteration finds, responding to change to aid the success of the system; and, (5) Feedback loops: some portion of the system’s output becomes fresh input for the system. In practice, complex systems exhibit unintuitive behaviors when they exist. Because complex systems appear in a wide variety of fields, the commonalities among them have become the subject of their own independent area of research. In many cases, it is useful to represent such a system as a model.\n",
  "Compliance": "The process of ensuring financial enterprises meet certain regulatory guidelines introduced by government bodies, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the U.S. These guidelines seek to protect investors, ensure consumer confidence, facilitate the transparency, efficiency, and fairness of markets while reduce financial crime and system risk.\n",
  "CompliFi": "A derivatives issuance protocol combined with an Automated Market Maker (AMM). It aims to allow users to trade and provide liquidity for derivatives as easily as for regular tokens on Uniswap.\n\nCompliFi addresses two key problems in decentralised derivatives: Defaults, margin calls, liquidations.\n\nAll CompliFi derivatives are fully backed by collateral at all times. A CompliFi user never faces a margin call or a liquidation. At the same time, a winning position will never suffer from a counterparty default.\n\nCompliFi AMM is designed to work with extremely volatile assets and incorporates a number of critical innovations that focus on protecting LP value. In particular, it reprices derivatives prior to trading in every block, dramatically decreasing the scope for impermanent losses. Just as importantly, the AMM algorithmically manages LP risk by preventing excessive market exposure of its pool. This is done by enforcing fixed exposure limits and through a dynamic fee mechanism that links a given transaction's fee to the change in pool risk that it causes.\n",
  "Composability": "A system design principle that deals with the inter-relationships of components. A highly composable system provides components that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to interoperate seamlessly. In cryptoeconomic  systems, the essential features that make a component composable are that it be self contained, stateless and interoperable with other system components.\n\n",

Compound Chain uses a native unit of account, CASH, as a means of standardizing value across disparate assets, and to incentivize validation. It is operated by a distributed group of validators all running the same state transition function. Each validator node executes the same state modification logic for every block mined by the chain, and also has the ability to execute \"sidecar\" functionality on every block, in the form of off-chain workers.\n",
  "Compound Finance": "A protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that establishes money markets, which are pools of assets with algorithmically derived interest rates, based on the supply and demand for the asset. Suppliers (and borrowers) of an asset interact directly with the protocol, earning (and paying) a floating interest rate, without having to negotiate terms such as maturity, interest rate, or collateral with a peer or counterparty. Each money market is unique to an Ethereum asset (such as Ether, an ERC-20 stablecoin such as DAI, or an ERC-20 utility token such as Augur), and contains a transparent and publicly-inspectable ledger, with a record of all transactions and historical interest rates. The protocol is governed and upgraded by COMP token-holders, using three distinct components; the COMP token, governance module (Governor Alpha), and Timelock. Together, these contracts allow the community to propose, vote, and implement changes through the administrative functions of a cToken or the Comptroller. Proposals can include changes like adjusting an interest rate model, to adding support for a new asset. Each asset supported by the Compound Protocol is integrated through a cToken contract, which is an EIP-20 compliant representation of balances supplied to the protocol. By minting cTokens, users (1) earn interest through the cToken's exchange rate, which increases in value relative to the underlying asset, and (2) gain the ability to use cTokens as collateral. Accrued interest is distributed to an insurance reserve.\n",
  "Compound Token": "Compound (COMP) is an ERC-20 asset that empowers community governance of the Compound protocol; COMP token-holders and their delegates debate, propose, and vote on all changes to the protocol. By placing COMP directly into the hands of users and applications, an increasingly large ecosystem will be able to upgrade the protocol, and will be incentivized to collectively steward the protocol into the future with good governance. Each time you interact with a Compound market (by supplying, borrowing, withdraw, or repaying the asset), COMP will be automatically transferred into your wallet, if you've accrued at least .001 COMP; at any time, you can manually withdraw all undistributed COMP. Any address with more than 100,000 COMP delegated to it may propose governance actions, which are executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can submit their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 400,000 votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after 2 days.\n",
  "Computational Backlog": "A set of calculations that must be completed to bring a backlog on the EOSIO blockchain up to date. Computational backlog occurs when a computer system or a blockchain network accumulates too much computational debt. This is a highly undesirable situation for a blockchain, because it can result in deteriorating system performance, including significant transaction time delays. Computational backlog must be managed efficiently to maintain the long-term health of the network. To help prevent computational backlog from happening, EOSIO block producers publish the network's available capacity for computation, state, and bandwidth.\n",

It could also be used for any system that makes use of voting, be it a political election or a DAO governance vote. Underlying this proposal is Vitalik's Minimal Mixer design, and the use of dapps such as tornado.cash that implement it.\n",
  "Confirmation": "A type of proof that a transaction was recorded and verified on the blockchain. The more confirmations a transaction has, the more certain one can be that this transaction will be integrated into the Blockchain in the long term. If the transaction is sent to the network in a valid block, then this transaction receives 1 confirmation. If a second block is published, which builds on this first block, then this transaction now has 2 confirmations. If a transaction only exists in the Mempool, but no block has been published yet that holds the transaction, then this transaction has 0 confirmations.\n",
  "Confluence": "Tthe combination of multiple strategies and ideas into one complete strategy. Confluence occurs when two or more separate ideas or strategies are used together to form a comprehensive investment strategy that is in line with an investor's risk profile and goals.

  "Constant Product Formula": "An algorithm used to determine the price of tokens on an automated market maker (AMM) platform. The formula maintains that tokens in a liquidity pool must remain at a fixed relative value. The most well-known formula is x * y = k, pioneered by the Uniswap protocol, which maintains that a pair of tokens in a liquidity pool must remain at equal total values. By fixing the relative value of the tokens, the formula is able to automatically determine pricing.\n",
  "Constantinople Reentrancy": "On January 16th, 2019, Constantinople protocol upgrade was delayed due to a security vulnerability enabled by EIP 1283. EIP 1283: Net gas metering for SSTORE without dirty maps proposes changes to reduce excessive gas costs on dirty storage writes. This change led to possibility of a new reentrancy vector making previously known secure withdrawal patterns (.send() and .transfer()) unsafe in specific situations*, where the attacker could hijack the control flow and use the remaining gas enabled by EIP 1283, leading to vulnerabilities due to reentrancy.\n",
  "Consumer Price Index": "A measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of consumer goods and services, such as transportation, food, and medical care. It is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them. Changes in the CPI are used to assess price changes associated with the cost of living.

Blockchain technology enables copyright authentication and transaction to be totally trackable. Users are responsible for their credit score, which is calculated based on every single contribution being made.\n",
  "Continuous Liquidity Pools": "Model used by Thorchain to facilitate continuous, incentivized liquidity. It consists of the following properties: (1) Provides “always-on” liquidity to all assets in its system; (2) Allows users to trade assets at transparent, fair prices, without relying on centralised third-parties; (3) Functions as source of trustless on-chain price feeds for internal and external use; (4) Democratises arbitrage opportunities; (5) Allows pools prices to converge to true market prices, since the fee asymptotes to zero; (6) Collects fee revenue for liquidity providers in a fair way; and (7) Responds to fluctuating demands of liquidity.\n",
  "Continuous Order Book": "A listing of parties interested in buying or selling an asset on a market. The list specifies the quantities and prices each buyer or seller is willing to accept for an exchange. A matching engine is concurrently used to pair the buyers and sellers, while the order book is updated in real time.\n",

  "Contract Separation": "A key design logic that underpins the Gemini dollar (GUSD) smart contract. Instead of a single unifying smart contract, Gemini dollar contracts are separated into multiple layers, each with a specific function. Contact separation increases the security and robustness of smart contracts within GUSD’s protocol.\n",
  "Contraktor": "A smart contract explorer - browse and visualize smart contracts, to understand the risks and value before transacting with them. It is a stand-alone application that automatically generates a UI from the smart contract's specification ('ABI'). These specifications are pulled from a block explorer (e.g. Etherscan) or can be managed on a more decentralized source, such as IPFS. Increased decentralization will increase transparency. The goal is to create a universally shared and open-source registry of verified smart contracts. Maintained and inspected by a diverse community of experts. Allowing anyone to visualize, interact and monitor these contracts through a common application that is understandable by anyone.\n",
  "Contribute": "A decentralized capital coordination tool that incentivizes the creation of a perpetual interest-generating pool through smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Contributed funds are exchanged to TRIB tokens that are issued through a bonding curve model to reward early risk takers for initially seeding the contract. All funds deposited in the pool are sent to a smart contract which optimizes yields on different lending protocols continuously generating interest. This interest can be claimed by any TRIB token holder as long as they sell the same dollar amount of TRIB back to the contract. A 10% fee is applied to anyone entering or exiting the pool. The fee is used to buy and burn TRIB tokens, permanently locking value in the lending protocol. This allows for a constant stream of interest to be generated for as long as there is demand for the underlying asset, benefiting every TRIB token holder.\n",
  "Contribution Mining": "Contribution mining is MCN's original form of mining. This type of mining does not use the amount of staked funds as a measurement standard, but determines the number of tokens obtained based on the size and duration of community members’ non-financial contributions to the community. This prevents big whales from plundering community resources through large amounts of funds and affecting the long-term development of MCN.\n\nContribution mining is rewarded via airdrops to community members, including GPs/LPs and community builders. GPs, as the key decision makers of the fund, bear the greatest responsibility and need to carefully screen, research, and analyze each of a large number of new projects to ensure the success of long-term success of MCN. LPs are responsible for the various parts of the fund’s operations, including fund DAO setup, MCN token distribution mechanics, post-investment management and support, and other responsibilities. As the actual investors in the fund’s treasury, GPs and LPs will receive any profits from the fund’s investments, as well as 50% of the contribution mining rewards for their contributions to MCN.\n\nContribution rewards for GPs/LPs will be distributed to GP/LP wallets via airdrops on a regular basis. This means that of the 50,000 MCN tokens that will be distributed to GPs/LPs, GPs will receive 2,500 per month, and LPs will receive 1,666.66 per month. These tokens will be distributed equally among the active GPs/LPs. Any GP/LP that exits MCN will no longer receive MCN tokens.\n\nThe rewards for community builders are determined based on their completion of MCN community tasks. A founding GP or other fund coordinator (can be a community builder volunteer) will propose a task list according to the current needs of MCN that community builders can volunteer to complete. When a task is completed, the coordinator proposes the token reward amount and submits it to GPs/LPs to vote for confirmation. Upon confirmation, the GP multi-sig wallet will issue the corresponding token airdrop reward.\n",
  "Convergence Finance": "A decentralized interchangeable asset protocol. Convergence Protocol is an Automated Market Maker (AMM) that allows anyone to swap among all types of tokens.

  "Convertible Virtual Currencies": "Pursuant to guidance from FinCEN, the term “virtual currency” refers to a medium of exchange that can operate like currency but does not have all the attributes of “real” currency, as defined in 31 CFR § 1010.100(m), including legal tender status. 15 15. 2013 VC Guidance, at 1; see also, inpra, section 3. CVC is a type of virtual currency that either has an equivalent value as currency, or acts as a substitute for currency, and is therefore a type of “value that substitutes for currency.” As mentioned above, the label applied to any particular type of CVC (such as “digital currency,” “cryptocurrency,” “cryptoasset,” “digital asset,” etc.) is not dispositive of its regulatory treatment under the BSA. Similarly, as money transmission involves the acceptance and transmission of value that substitutes for currency by any means, transactions denominated in CVC will be subject to FinCEN regulations regardless of whether the CVC is represented by a physical or digital token, whether the type of ledger used to record the transactions is centralized or distributed, or the type of technology utilized for the transmission of value.\n",
  "Convex Finance": "A platform built to boost rewards for CRV stakers and liquidity providers alike, all in a simple and easy to use interface. Convex aims to simplify staking on Curve, as well as the CRV-locking system with the help of its native fee-earning token: CVX.

CRV stakers and liquidity providers also receive liquidity mining rewards in the form of CVX.\n",
  "Convexity": "A generalized noncustodial options protocol for Decentralized Finance (DeFi). By depositing crypto-collateral (e.g. ERC20s or ETH), and specifying certain key parameters (e.g. underlying asset, strike price, expiry date, etc.), options writers are able to mint arbitrary fungible ERC20 option tokens called oTokens. Selling those minted oTokens allows writers to earn premiums, thereby generating revenue on their collateral. Buyers can then purchase these oTokens, which trade on exchanges such as 0x or Uniswap, ensuring market liquidity.\n",
  "Conveyor": "A service created by Automata Network that ingests and outputs transactions in a determined order. This creates a front-running-free zone that removes the chaos of transaction reordering.\n\nWhen transactions are fed into Conveyor, it determines the order of the incoming transactions and makes it impossible for block producers to perform the following:\n\n1. Inject new transactions into the Conveyor output: The inserted transactions bypassing Conveyor is detectable by anyone because of signature mismatch.\n2. Delete ordered transactions: Transactions accepted by Conveyor are broadcasted everywhere so transactions cannot be deleted unless ALL block producers are colluding and censoring the transactions at the same time.\n\nFrom the DEX's perspective, they can choose to accept either:\n\n1. Ordered transactions from Automata's Conveyor which is free from transaction reordering and other front-running transactions\n2. Other unordered transactions (which include front-running etc) that may negatively impact their users\n\nAutomata's Conveyor runs on a decentralized compute plane backed by many Geode instances. Each Geode instance can be attested so anyone can publicly verify that the Geode is running on a system with genuine hardware (i.e., CPU) and that the Geode application code matches the version that is open-sourced and audited. This provides a strong guarantee that:\n\n The Geode code is untampered with\n The Geode data is inaccessible to even Geode providers (In which case they cannot act on said data to front-run transactions)\n\nImportantly, Automata's Conveyor is a chain-agnostic solution to the MEV issue, and works seamlessly on various platforms — zero modifications needed.\n",
  "Coordinator": "A centralized master node on the IOTA DAG network that curates and approves all transactions.

  "CORE Token": "A non-inflationary cryptocurrency that is designed to execute profit-generating strategies autonomously with a completely decentralized approach. In existing autonomous strategy-executing platforms a team or single developer is solely responsible for determining how locked funds are used to generate ROI. This is hazardous to the health of the fund as it grows, as it creates flawed incentives, and invites mistakes to be made. CORE does away with this dynamic and instead opts for one with decentralized governance.\n\nCORE tokens holders will be able to provide strategy contracts and vote on what goes live and when, in order to decentralize autonomous strategy execution. 5% of all profits generated from these strategies are used to auto market-buy the CORE token.\n",
  "Corporate Bond": "A type of debt security that is issued by a firm and sold to investors. The company gets the capital it needs and in return the investor is paid a pre-established number of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest rate. When the bond expires, or \"reaches maturity,\" the payments cease and the original investment is returned.\n\nThe backing for the bond is generally the ability of the company to repay, which depends on its prospects for future revenues and profitability. In some cases, the company's physical assets may be used as collateral.\n",
  "Correction": "In investing, a correction is a decline of 10% or more in the price of a security from its most recent peak. Corrections can happen to individual assets, like an individual stock or bond, or to an index measuring a group of assets. An asset, index, or market may fall into a correction either briefly or for sustained periods—days, weeks, months, or even longer. However, the average market correction is short-lived and lasts anywhere between three and four months. Investors, traders, and analysts use charting methods to predict and track corrections. Many factors can trigger a correction. From a large-scale macroeconomic shift to problems in a single company's management plan, the reasons behind a correction are as varied as the stocks, indexes, or markets they affect.\n",
  "Correlation": "A statistic that measures the degree to which two securities move in relation to each other. Correlations are used in advanced portfolio management, computed as the correlation coefficient, which has a value that must fall between -1.0 and +1.0. A perfect positive correlation means that the correlation coefficient is exactly 1. This implies that as one security moves, either up or down, the other security moves in lockstep, in the same direction. A perfect negative correlation means that two assets move in opposite directions, while a zero correlation implies no linear relationship at all.\n\nInvestment managers, traders, and analysts find it very important to calculate correlation because the risk reduction benefits of diversification rely on this statistic. Financial spreadsheets and software can calculate the value of correlation quickly.\n",
  "COS Token": "The native token of the Contentos system. COS has more than 100 million potential cold-start users worldwide. 10 billion COS tokens will be issued, which are ERC-20 Token Standard tokens based on the Ethereum protocol.

  "CosmicSwap": "A yield farm and aggregator that is currently on the Binance Smart Chain and the Polygon Network. CosmicSwap allows users to stake their tokens and earn $COSMIC as a reward. It was designed and developed by a team of developers who analyzed other farms, both successful and unsuccessful, and noted what worked and what did not. As such, they created CosmicSwap by taking the best features of farms and dapps that are successful and leaving features out that obviously did not work. The pools were initially the most popular on the network at launch such as COSMIC, WBNB, DOT, etc however with partnerships they created more pools in line with those partnerships. CosmicSwap believes in having a strong community and as such, not only does the community vote on proposed pools suggest on social media but CosmicSwap has a voting system in order for the community to propose changes they desire.\n",

  "COT Token": "Token of Apricot Finance. When Apricot reaches a sufficient scale, they plan to launch a bad debt processing token, COT, whose value is derived from the market value of collaterals in the COT pool accumulated through Apricot Rescue. COT can be purchased and redeemed as an investment vehicle in its own right for users to trade on expectations of short-term price volatility or long-term value appreciation. At a given point in time, the value of each COT is determined by the market value of the assets in the COT pool and the total number of minted COTs.

  "Credit Risk": "The possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower's failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations. Traditionally, it refers to the risk that a lender may not receive the owed principal and interest, which results in an interruption of cash flows and increased costs for collection. Excess cash flows may be written to provide additional cover for credit risk. When a lender faces heightened credit risk, it can be mitigated via a higher coupon rate, which provides for greater cash flows.\n\nAlthough it's impossible to know exactly who will default on obligations, properly assessing and managing credit risk can lessen the severity of a loss. Interest payments from the borrower or issuer of a debt obligation are a lender's or investor's reward for assuming credit risk.\n",

Units will be sold in random unit packs on <http://cryptoassault.io> but ultimately players will want to trade units amongst each other as they seek matching units to upgrade. Although there will be an overall meta, demand will also be unique to players as they search to upgrade their ideal army. The game is a hybrid on-chain/off-chain dapp. The units are ERC-721 tokens purchased on-chain but the game actions are all off-chain. This ensures that players will be able to move, attack and play the game without having to pay and wait for each action. Players will still need to purchase units and pay a small fee for upgrading units since upgrading is creating a new ERC-721 token.\n",

  "CurioInvest": "Collectible cars as an asset class have significantly outperformed many traditional indices such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones over the past 15 years. However, this investment opportunity has only been available to a small group of elite investors due to the following barriers of entry to the market: (1) truly rare cars are sold through narrow, elite networks; (2) such vehicles often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, which means that the minimum stake is very high; (3) expertise is required to store and maintain the vehicles; (4) specialist knowledge is needed to verify the provenance of the vehicles; and (5) the purchase, insurance and sale of the vehicles involves a lot of administration and paperwork\n\nIn combination, these factors have made this asset class even more exclusive than hedge funds, venture capital or private equity funds. CurioInvest's mission is to make it possible for everyone to invest in rare collectable vehicles. Based in Switzerland and Lichtenstein, CurioInvest is launching an online platform powered by blockchain technology which enables investors to purchase security tokens directly backed by limited edition collectable cars. These tokens allow investors to share in the profit if the value of the underlying vehicle increases.\n\nIn this way, CurioInvest is eliminating the barriers to entry to the collectable car market. As a fractional stake in a vehicle can be purchased online for as little as $500, the minimum investment required to enter the market is dramatically lowered, enabling investors to diversify by purchasing stakes in multiple vehicles.\n\nIn addition, the CurioInvest platform will greatly simplify the investment process – investors can register and purchase tokens online, while CurioInvest Invest manages the purchase, maintenance, insurance and sale of the vehicle, as well as all related administration and paperwork.\n\nThe CurioInvest team has a proven track record of profitably trading investment-grade cars at Mercuria Helvetica AG and has access to a pipeline of over 500 rare, collectable vehicles. In addition, CurioInvest has partnered with Mechatronik GmbH to store and maintain the vehicles.\n\nThe CurioInvest Invest platform will bring unprecedented transparency, security and liquidity to a market that was previously only accessible to elites. Ultimately, CurioInvest aims to become the Nasdaq of collectable vehicles, hosting an exchange where automotive security tokens can be traded in near real time.\n",

Central banks and governments can intervene to help stabilize a currency by selling off reserves of foreign currency or gold, or by intervening in the forex markets.\n",
  "Currency Pair": "A currency pair is the quotation of two different currencies, with the value of one currency being quoted against the other. The first listed currency of a currency pair is called the base currency, and the second currency is called the quote currency. Currency pairs compare the value of one currency to another—the base currency (or the first one) versus the second, or the quote currency. It indicates how much of the quote currency is needed to purchase one unit of the base currency. Currencies are identified by an ISO currency code, or the three-letter alphabetic code they are associated with on the international market. So, for the U.S. dollar, the ISO code would be USD.\n",
  "Curve": "An exchange liquidity pool on Ethereum designed for (1) extremely efficient stablecoin trading; and (2) low risk, supplemental fee income for liquidity providers. Curve allows users and smart contracts to trade between stablecoins with a bespoke low slippage, low fee algorithm designed specifically for stablecoins. Behind the scenes, the liquidity pool is supplied to the various protocols, where it generates income for liquidity providers. Most decentralized exchanges are costly for stablecoin exchanges because they typically don't offer stablecoin-to-stablecoin trading pairs; a given stablecoin is exchanged for ETH first before a second transaction that converts that ETH to the desired stablecoin. Curve bypasses that weakness and allows for the direct swapping of one stablecoin to another stablecoin. This allows users to save on trading fees. Curve also offers minimal slippage. This is achieved through the use of an automated market marker (AMM) formula. Rates for each stablecoin pair are based on the attributes of each token.\n",
  "Curve DAO Token": "The main purposes of the Curve DAO token are to incentivise liquidity providers on the Curve Finance platform as well as getting as many users involved as possible in the governance of the protocol. Currently CRV has three main uses: (1) voting, (2) staking, and (3) boosting. Those three things will require you to vote-lock your CRV and acquire veCRV. Once CRV holders vote-lock their veCRV, they can start voting on various DAO proposals and pool parameters. In addition, CRV can now be staked (locked) to receive trading fees from the Curve protocol. A community-lead proposal introduced a 50% admin fee on all trading fees. Those fees are collected and used to buy 3CRV, the LP token for the TriPool, which are then distributed to veCRV holders. Finally, boosting entails locking up one's CRV to boost one's rewards (up to 2.5x) on provided liquidity.\n",
  "Curve Gauge System": "On Curve Finance, the inflation is going to users who provide liquidity. This usage is measured with gauges. The liquidity gauge measures how much a user is providing in liquidity. Each Curve pool has its own liquidity gauge where you can stake your liquidity provider tokens. Each gauge also has a weight and a type. Those weights represent how much of the daily CRV inflation will be received by the liquidity gauge.\n",

  "Customer Identification Program": "Established by the U.S. Patriot Act of 2001 and implemented in 2003, the Customer Identification Program (CIP) prescribes the minimum standards with which financial institutions must confirm the identity of a new customer in connection with opening an account. Each financial institution's CIP is proportional to the its size and type of business, types of accounts offered, methods of opening accounts, and other factors. The objective of this program is to minimize the degree to which the U.S. financial system is used for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.\n",
  "CVX Token": "The native platform token for Convex Finance. CVX can be staked for platform fees. Staked CVX will receive its portion of the platform fees as cvxCRV (tokenized veCRV). This is to keep CRV in the system building boost, but users can trade out their cvxCRV through the cvxCRV/CRV liquidity pool. Convex platform fees that would be returned to CVX stakers are locked in veCRV, and tokenized as cvxCRV and given to the CVX stakers. CVX is rewarded to CRV stakers and Curve.fi liquidity pools pro-rata to CRV generated by the platform. If users are in a high CRV rewards liquidity pool, they will receive more CVX for their efforts. CVX is also distributed to cvxCRV/CRV and CVX/ETH LPs that stake their LP tokens on the Convex platform through a Masterchef staking rewards contract.\n",
  "cvxCRV Token": "Tokenized veCRV that is created by depositing CRV token into Convex Finance. When CRV is deposited into Convex Finance, that CRV is locked forever on the platform as veCRV. A tokenized version of veCRV, cvxCRV, is returned to the user at a 1:1 rate. cvxCRV can be staked into the platform to receive normal Curve platform fees one would get for staking their veCRV on Curve.fi, as 3CRV. Additionally, users staking cvxCRV will receive CRV from Convex's performance fee, as well as the platform native token CVX.\n",
  "Cyber Assisted Response Directives": "The primary battle mechanic at the heart of Neon District with millions of possible combinations to make the gamer's team unique from any other team. Card Decks, also called Card Pools, are made up of 10 character C.A.R.D.s and 10 weapon C.A.R.D.s. Each equipped character always has a starting deck of 20 cards (characters without a weapon equipped will be given 10 basic attack cards), which can be changed throughout the course of a battle. Some card effects can remove or add cards to a deck, and others can increase or decrease the likelihood of drawing a card.\n\nAt the start of each character's turn, a selection of three cards are chosen from the full pool of cards and made available for a player to choose from. Some of these cards will automatically take effect and do not need to be selected — these are Effect cards. All cards have a specific Tick Cost that are incurred when using them.\n\nWhen a character's turn is over, the available cards are shuffled back into that character's pool, and the next time the character is up, another three cards are chosen at random from the full pool. There is no discard pile, though cards can be removed from a pool through other effects.\n",
  "Cyberattack": "Any type of offensive maneuver that targets computer information systems, infrastructures, computer networks, or personal computer devices. An attacker is a person or process that attempts to access data, functions or other restricted areas of the system without authorization, potentially with malicious intent. Depending on context, cyberattacks can be part of cyberwarfare or cyberterrorism. A cyberattack can be employed by sovereign states, individuals, groups, society or organizations, and it may originate from an anonymous source. A product that facilitates a cyberattack is sometimes called a cyberweapon.\n\nA cyberattack may steal, alter, or destroy a specified target by hacking into a susceptible system. Cyberattacks can range from installing spyware on a personal computer to attempting to destroy the infrastructure of entire nations. Legal experts are seeking to limit the use of the term to incidents causing physical damage, distinguishing it from the more routine data breaches and broader hacking activities.\n\nCyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated and dangerous.\n\nUser behavior analytics and SIEM can be used to help prevent these attacks.\n",

  "Daemon": "In multitasking computer operating systems, a daemon is a computer program that runs as a background process, rather than being under the direct control of an interactive user. Traditionally, the process names of a daemon end with the letter d, for clarification that the process is in fact a daemon, and for differentiation between a daemon and a normal computer program. For example, syslogd is a daemon that implements system logging facility, and sshd is a daemon that serves incoming SSH connections. Systems often start daemons at boot time that will respond to network requests, hardware activity, or other programs by performing some task. Daemons such as cron may also perform defined tasks at scheduled times.\n",
  "DAI": "A crypto collateralized stablecoin whose value is pegged to the US Dollar. All circulating Dai are generated from Maker Vaults and are backed by a surplus of assets, with collateral ratios that vary based on the collateral strength. Dai is used in the same manner as any other cryptocurrency: It can be freely sent to others, used as payments for goods and services, be held as a hedge against market volatility, deposited into the DSR for low risk yield, and much more. Dai is not a hard-pegged currency, so it does not perfectly track USD; rather, it maintains a free-floating peg that experiences extremely low volatility.\n\nDAI is also known as Multi-Collateral DAI to differentiate it from Single Collateral DAI (also known as SAI).\n",
  "Dai Para Principiantes": "A spanish-first Dai and Defi educational website, tutorials & active community.\n",

  "DangerMoon": "SafeMoon but with random (read: dangerous) payouts. DangerMoon keeps a prize pool of 5% of every buy and sell in a field named currentReflection. Any community member can send 0.2 Chainlink into the DangerMoon contract at any time to make the prize pool go to a random winner.\n\nOn the very next transaction, the smart contract will see that it has enough Chainlink, spend that 0.2 Chainlink to request a random number from the BSC Chainlink oracle, and then when it gets that random number back, it uses it to distribute all of the tokens in currentReflection to some lucky winner.\n\nThey use Chainlink because it is the only way to get a verifiably fair random number into a smart contract. If the community prefers to have lots of small distributions, they can send lots of Chainlink to the contract. Every distribution costs the contract 0.2 Chainlink. So long as the contract has Chainlink to spend, it will request random numbers and make distributions until it runs out of Chainlink. When the contract does not have Chainlink to spend, the prize pool will grow until someone decides its worth sending in 0.2 Chainlink for a chance to win. They chose this path to allow the community to decide what size distributions are most exciting.\n\nChainlink waits 10 blocks to return a random number, to ensure truly fair random numbers. Blocks on the Binance Smart Chain take around 5 seconds, so this means the contract will distribute reflection fees no more than once every 50 seconds.\n",
  "Dango": "A leverage protocol. Dango is powered by Aave (utilizing Flashloans and Credit delegation) and 0x API on Polygon. Positions opened using Dango are kept in a proxy wallet (owned only by the user), hence their positions are isolated from their main Aave positions. Leveraging is done using taking a flashloan on Aave on DAI and swapping it to ETH using 0x API. Which is deposited in Aave with user's collateral using credit delegation. All the positions opened on Dango will receive $MATIC liquidity mining rewards. If the collateral and debt are different tokens, a fee of 0.1% is levied on the trade by Dango. Aave charges 0.09% fees for flashloans during only deleveraging. The primary risk in leveraging is assets can get liquidated on Aave due to high volatility, when the health factor goes under 1 or debt utilization is above 100%.\n",
  "DANK Token": "A brand new ERC20 token that powers the Dank Registry, and gives Meme Factory users the power to vote on what memes get minted and which don’t, and facilitates more in-depth governance over the parameters of the registry (when and how challenges are made and votes are won, how much of the reward goes to which party, and various other decisions). The token can be acquired through several means, the most immediate of which is a one-time faucet which will dispense DANK to a connected Ethereum wallet. In order to claim yours, navigate to the DANK faucet via the left-hand navigation menu “Get DANK” button. Challenging new memes entering the registry is a higher-risk, higher-reward means of earning DANK. Challenging a meme initiates a voting period, as described above. However, unlike simply voting for or against a meme where you can only gain DANK, starting a challenge requires the challenger to actually risk the same amount of DANK as the meme creator put forward to submit the meme. If the vote goes against the challenger, and the meme is accepted into the registry, the challenger will lose their DANK.\n",

Land is divided into parcels that are identified by cartesian coordinates (x,y). These parcels are permanently owned by members of the community and are purchased using MANA, Decentraland’s cryptocurrency token. This gives users full control over the environments and applications that they create, which can range from anything like static 3D scenes to more interactive applications or games. Some parcels are further organized into themed communities, or Districts. By organizing parcels into Districts, the community can create shared spaces with common interests and uses. Users can find a list of the original District Proposals on GitHub. The content that makes up Decentraland is stored and distributed via a decentralized network while ownership and transactions are validated on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",
  "Decentraland DAO": "The DAO that owns the most important smart contracts and assets that make up Decentraland – the LAND Contract, the Estates Contract, Wearables, Content Servers and the Marketplace. It also owns a substantial purse of MANA which allows it to be truly autonomous as well as subsidize various operations and initiatives throughout Decentraland. Through the DAO, users are in control of the policies created to determine how the world behaves: for example, what kinds of wearable items are allowed (or disallowed) after the launch of the DAO, moderation of content, LAND policy and auctions, among others. The community will propose and vote on policy updates, future LAND auctions, whitelisting of NFT contracts to be allowed inside the World, Builder and Marketplace, and whatever the community deems relevant. Voting takes place on the Decentraland DAO's governance interface, powered by Aragon.\n",
  "Decentraland Marketplace": "The place for users to trade and manage all of their Decentraland on-chain assets. The marketplace allows users to:\n\n Sell parcels and Estates of LAND, wearables, and unique names. Set their own price in MANA and an expiration date for the offer.\n Buy parcels and Estates, wearables, and unique names that are for sale.\n Transfer their parcels and Estates to another user.\n Explore the world through a map to see who owns what, what wearables exist and what names are claimed.\n",
  "Decentralised Information Asset": "An ecosystem for open financial data in a financial smart contract ecosystem. The target of DIA is to bring together data analysts, data providers and data users. In general, DIA provides a reliable and verifiable bridge between off-chain data from various sources and on-chain smart contracts that can be used to build a variety of financial dApps.\n",
  "Decentralized": "The process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.\n",
  "Decentralized Application": "As opposed to centralized applications that run on a single computer, decentralized applications run on a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network of computers. They have existed since the advent of P2P networks. Decentralized applications do not necessarily need to run on top of a blockchain network. Tor, BitTorrent, Popcorn Time, BitMessage, are examples for decentralized applications that run on a P2P network, but not on a blockchain – which is a special kind of P2P network. Decentralized applications are a piece of software that communicates with the blockchain, which manages the state of all network actors. The interface of the decentralized applications does not look any different than any website or mobile app today. The smart contract represents the core logic of a decentralized application. Smart contracts are integral building blocks of blockchains, that process information from external sensors or events and help the blockchain manage the state of all network actors. The frontend of a decentralized application represents what you see, and the backend represents the entire business logic. This business logic is represented by one or several smart contracts interacting with the underlying blockchain. Decentralized applications are similar to a traditional Web application. The frontend uses the exact same technology to render the page. It contains a \"wallet\" that communicates with the blockchain. The wallet manages cryptographic keys and the blockchain address. Public-key infrastructure is used for user identification and authentication. Instead of an API connecting to a database, a wallet software triggers activities of a smart contract, which interacts with a blockchain.\n",
  "Decentralized Autonomous Association": "A Decentralized Autonomous Association aims to establish a decentralized and democratic legal entity structure with flat hierarchies. Therefore, centralization points should be reduced as much as (legally) possible.\n",
  "Decentralized Autonomous Community": "Term that refers to digital organizations that use blockchain to do things that could never be done by traditional organizations. This is important because just like today’s apps are held by corporations and organizations, Dapps will need to be held by something.\n",
  "Decentralized Autonomous Corporation": "A subclass of DAOs. Since the main exponent of DAC as terminology is Daniel Larimer, we will borrow as a definition the point that he himself consistently promotes: a DAC pays dividends. That is, there is a concept of shares in a DAC which are purchaseable and tradeable in some fashion, and those shares potentially entitle their holders to continual receipts based on the DAC’s success. A DAO is non-profit; though you can make money in a DAO, the way to do that is by participating in its ecosystem and not by providing investment into the DAO itself. Obviously, this distinction is a murky one; all DAOs contain internal capital that can be owned, and the value of that internal capital can easily go up as the DAO becomes more powerful/popular, so a large portion of DAOs are inevitably going to be DAC-like to some extent. Thus, the distinction is more of a fluid one and hinges on emphasis: to what extent are dividends the main point, and to what extent is it about earning tokens by participation? Also, to what extent does the concept of a “share” exist as opposed to simple virtual property? For example, a membership on a nonprofit board is not really a share, because membership frequently gets granted and confiscated at will, something which would be unacceptable for something classified as investable property, and a bitcoin is not a share because a bitcoin does not entitle you to any claim on profits or decision-making ability inside the system, whereas a share in a corporation definitely is a share. In the end, perhaps the distinction might ultimately be the surprisingly obscure point of whether or not the profit mechanism and the consensus mechanism are the same thing.\n",
  "Decentralized Autonomous Initial Coin Offering": "The DAICO is an improvement on the ICO fundraising model that incorporates certain aspects of DAO’s. The idea was suggested by Vitalik Buterin in January 2018 and is aimed at making ICO’s more secure by involving investors in the initial project development process. It will further enable token holders to vote for the refund of the contributed funds if they are not happy with the progress being made by developers. For projects that implement the DAICO concept, it will force a level of accountability on developers and give token holders additional peace of mind that they are guaranteed to either see at least a minimum viable product or get their money back.\n",
  "Decentralized Autonomous Organizations": "An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that is transparent, controlled by the organization members and not influenced by a central government. A DAO's financial transaction record and program rules are maintained on a blockchain. DAOs tackle an age-old problem of governance, which political scientists and economists refer to as the principal-agent dilemma. This occurs when the agent of an organization has the power to make decisions on behalf of, or impacting, the principal – another person or entity in the organization. Examples hereof could be managers that act on behalf of shareholders or politicians that act on behalf of citizens. In such setups, moral hazard occurs when one person takes more risks than they normally would, because others bear the cost of those risks. More generally, it occurs when the agent acts in his own interest rather than the interest of the principal because the principal cannot fully control the agent's actions. This dilemma usually increases when there is underlying information asymmetry at play.\n\nIn traditional companies, all agents of a company have employment contracts that regulate their relationship with the organization and with each other. Their rights and obligations are regulated by legal contracts and enforced by a legal system which is subject to the underlying governing law of the country they reside in. If anything goes wrong, or someone does not stick to their end of the bargain, the legal contract will define who can be sued for what in a court of law.\n\nDAOs, on the other hand, involve a set of people interacting with each other according to a self-enforcing open-source protocol. Keeping the network safe and performing other network tasks is rewarded with the native network tokens. Blockchains and smart contracts hereby reduce transaction costs of management at higher levels of transparency, aligning the interests of all stakeholders by the consensus rules tied to the native token. Individual behaviour is incentivized with a token to collectively contribute to a common goal. Members of a DAO are not bound together by a legal entity, nor have they entered into any formal legal contracts. Instead, they are steered by incentives tied to the network tokens, and fully transparent rules that are written into the piece of software, which is enforced by machine consensus. There are no bilateral agreements. There is only one governing law – the protocol or smart contract – regulating the behaviour of all network participants.\n\nAs opposed to traditional companies that are structured in a top-down manner, with many layers of management and bureaucratic coordination, DAOs provide an operating system for people and institutions that do not know nor trust each other, who might live in different geographical areas, speak different languages, and therefore be subject to different jurisdictions. Instead of legal contracts managing the relations of the people, all agreements are in the form of open-source code that is self-enforced by majority consensus of all network actors. DAOs do not have a hierarchical structure, except for the code. Once deployed, this entity is independent of its creator and cannot be censored by one single entity, but instead by a predefined majority of the organization's participants. The exact majority rules are defined in the consensus protocol or the smart contract, and will vary from use case to use case. In some countries, like Austria for example, there are trends in the legal literature to see DAOs as a civil law partnership.\n",
  "Decentralized Commerce": "A subdivision of Decentralized Finance that specializes in payments, subscriptions, invoicing and shopping, along with other consumer facing products.\n",
  "Decentralized Exchange": "A peer-to-peer exchange that allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrency and other assets without a central intermediary involved. Decentralized exchanges differ from centralized exchanges as they enable users to remain in control of their funds by operating their critical functions on the blockchain: they leverage the technology behind cryptocurrencies themselves to enable a safer and more transparent trading. It solves the main limitations faced by cryptocurrency markets, since there is no single point of failure, aligning them with what has made the blockchain technology so powerful in the first place. Most decentralized exchanges are not fully decentralized, but semi-decentralized (full decentralization is today more of an ideal, due to limitations listed hereunder). In most cases, servers (centralized) still host order books (among other features) but do not hold private keys. Another central aspect is that decentralized exchanges present the characteristics, benefits and limitations, of their underlying blockchain.\n",
  "Decentralized Finance": "An experimental form of finance that does not rely on central financial intermediaries such as brokerages, exchanges, or banks, and instead utilizes smart contracts on blockchains, the most common being Ethereum. DeFi platforms allow people to lend or borrow funds from others, speculate on price movements on a range of assets using derivatives, trade cryptocurrencies, insure against risks, and earn interest in a savings-like account. Some DeFi applications promote high interest rates, with some providers offering triple-digit interest rates, but are subject to high risk. As of October 2020, over $11 billion was deposited in various decentralized finance protocols, which represents more than a tenfold growth during the course of 2020.\n\nDeFi revolves around applications known as DApps (decentralized applications) that perform financial functions on digital ledgers called blockchains, a technology that was invented for Bitcoin but has since caught on more broadly. Rather than transactions being with and through a centralised intermediary such as a cryptocurrency exchange, transactions are directly between participants, mediated by smart contract programs. DApps are typically accessed through a Web3 enabled browser extension or application, such as MetaMask. Many of these DApps can connect and work together to create complex financial services. For example, stablecoin holders can commit assets to a liquidity pool. Others can borrow from this pool, by contributing additional collateral, typically more than the amount of the loan. The protocol automatically adjusts interest rates based upon the moment-to-moment demand for the asset.\n",
  "Decentralized Flexible Organization": "An Ethereum-based Research & Development project. They are On-Chain companies with proprietary assets and voting tokens as programmable equities. Made with ❤️ by Ethereans for Ethereans. DFOs have a microservices-driven design.

By design, every DFO deployed by DFOhub features the security and trustlessness required to address concerns about dApp dependency and resilience. The fear, uncertainty and doubt has been resolved.\n",
  "Decentralized Forex": "Product of the Neutrino Protocol. It is an extension that facilitates seamless swaps and staking of stable-price assets pegged to national currencies, indices and commodities. It is an open-source and can be potentially integrated into any interface. The Decentralized Forex (DeFo) extension comes as the first step towards the creation of a truly decentralized global financial system. At a time when DeFi revolutionizes the traditional banking system, the creation of frictionless bridges between crypto and fiat is crucial. DeFo is a major step in that direction as it opens up opportunities for high-interest savings and cheap remittances, leveraging the Waves blockchain's high speed and low fees. As DeFi aims to augment traditional finance rather than replace it, bridging the fiat and crypto spaces is vital. And DeFo is set to play a major role in this process. By launching DeFo, Neutrino aims to enable easy access to financial instruments, such as savings, investments and currency exchange, for residents of those countries where local banking systems are inadequate or offer unfavorable conditions.\n",
  "Decentralized Governance": "For blockchain networks and dApps, decentralized governance refers to the processes through which the disintermediated, equitable management of a platform is executed. It involves different methodologies for voting on platform tech, strategy, updates, and rules. Blockchain governance is typically conducted using two distinct systems: on-chain governance and off-chain governance. On-chain governance relies upon blockchain-based systems, typically using automatic cryptographic algorithms through the network’s computational architecture and underlying consensus mechanism. Off-chain governance refers to decision making that is not codified on the blockchain, often on online forums or face-to-face.\n",
  "Decentralized Identifiers": "A new type of identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. A Decentralized Identifier (DID) identifies any subject (e.g., a person, organization, thing, data model, abstract entity, etc.) that the controller of the DID decides that it identifies. In contrast to typical, federated identifiers, DIDs have been designed so that they may be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers, and certificate authorities. Specifically, while other parties might be used to help enable the discovery of information related to a DID, the design enables the controller of a DID to prove control over it without requiring permission from any other party. DIDs are URIs that associate a DID subject with a DID document allowing trustable interactions associated with that subject. Each DID document can express cryptographic material, verification methods, or service endpoints, which provide a set of mechanisms enabling a DID controller to prove control of the DID. Service endpoints enable trusted interactions associated with the DID subject. A DID document might contain the DID subject itself, if the DID subject is an information resource such as a data model.\n",

  "DeepDAO": "A DAO whose mission is to explore, rank and analyze all DAOs in several dimensions. This includes DAOs created on one of the four major platforms (DAOstack, Aragon, 👹 Moloch, and Colony), as well as those created for specific needs such as The LAO, MakerDAO, and Nexus Mutual. In simple terms, Deep DAO is to DAOs what CoinMarketCap is to tokens: a place to check rankings, as well as financial and governance analysis about each one. While rankings are cool and attractive, it is not enough for properly understanding DAOs. DAOs are far more complex creatures than tokens and as such, Deep DAO goes beyond those basics. Deep DAO explores nuanced interactions involving whole communities and a large range of behaviors, economic and otherwise. We are developing a system for evaluating DAOs in terms of financial stability and responsibility, internal participation rates in total and over time, and how they correlate with other factors. Since DAOs can make investments, we are developing ways of tracking the performance of these investments as part of the DAOs metrics. Thus, businesses and individuals using our data would be better able to choose a DAO suitable to their needs.\n",

  "Delta": "Delta measures the rate of change of the theoretical option value with respect to changes in the underlying asset's price. Delta is the first derivative of the value of the option with respect to the underlying instrument's price. For example, if an option has Delta of 0.65, this means that if the underlying asset changes in price by $1 per token, the option value on it will also change by $0.65 per contract, all else being equal. We say “theoretical” option value and not just option value because the delta relies on a the option value calculated by Black-Scholes, and so does not always correspond to the present market value of the option.\n\nDelta is positive when buying a call, Delta is negative when buying a put. Delta is reversed when writing calls and puts. This can be understood by knowing that, all things being equal, a buying a call makes money if the underlying asset price goes up, and buying a put makes money if the underlying asset price goes down. A call that starts out with very little Delta can have a very large Delta if the underlying asset price rises sufficiently.\n",
  "Delta Exchange": "A cryptocurrency derivatives trading platform.

Based on this vision, Equality Protocol aims to formalize people on Ethereum. It is the fundamental building block for democratic Ethereum applications. Any Ethereum account can call Equality’s functions to calculate the so-called Equality score for any one Ethereum account. This is a probabilistic score between -1.00 and 1.00 that indicates the personhood of an Ethereum account. Higher Equality scores signal that an account is the unique social Ethereum account of one person. The scores for an account are derived from its memberships in DAOs on Ethereum, in particular from specific subjective and objective properties of these DAOs. While Equality scores constitute the “people” on Ethereum, Equality applications are the spaces where democratic rule-making happens. Just to name a few possibilities, consider applications for borderless, censorship-resistant elections, basic incomes, or quadratic funding programs. Every human has equal rights to the social benefits of Equality applications. The social and multidimensional nature of Equality scores makes Sybil attacks of Equality applications super expensive, even given significant advances in machine intelligence.\n",

  "DEUS finance": "A DeFi protocol that enables users to hold and trade blockchain derivatives of traditional assets such as stocks and indices on the Ethereum network. It does so through Registrars, virtual copies of assets or baskets of assets, pegged 1:1 to their real-world equivalents. Each Registrar is represented with its own ERC-20 token (rToken). The current market value of assets is continuously provided to the system via oracles. Assets can include cryptocurrencies, stocks, bonds, or commodities - virtually any asset whose value a market can capture. There will be mechanisms in place preventing the creation of fraudulent or illegal Registrars. Moreover, high-risk investments will be separated from those with low risks. Users invest in Registrars through a platform called Registrar Conductor. Their funds are moved to the treasury, and rTokens are minted in return. Once a user decides to sell their investment, they go to DEUS Swap, our decentralized exchange, during official stock trading hours (tokens can still be moved around the Ethereum blockchain outside the regular trading hours, creating a 24/7 secondary market). rTokens are burned by Swap and an amount equivalent to the current market value of the underlying asset(s) is paid from the treasury. Users may also trade their rTokens through other exchanges, such as Uniswap, or even stake them. If by some chance rTokens significantly go up in value, and everyone decides to cash out at once, the treasury’s funds would not suffice. That’s why a major part of DEUS is incentivizing the provision of liquidity. In order to provide liquidity users go to the Sands of Time Vaults, where a smart contract locks their tokens for a set period of time in exchange for yields. The longer the tokens are locked - the higher the reward. Together, the Vaults back a stablecoin called DEA (latin for “goddess”, nothing to do with drug enforcement), the most important token in our ecosystem. Our unique selling point is the decoupling of traders and LP’s. This is the difference between DEUS and projects like SNX or Linear Finance. We give traders the possibility to enter the markets without providing any collateral.\n",

Simply put, the DMCA protects creative works on the internet whilst affording specific protection to copyright owners and internet providers. Furthermore, the DMCA provides the legal framework for the management of rights in digital works. Digital works include: articles, photographs, videos, and website content. Whilst, it is only enforceable against United States hosted content, the DMCA is in compliance with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty, as well as the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. These treaties provide an international framework for the management and protection of copyright. More than half of the WIPO member states are contracting parties to these treaties, and have committed to adopt necessary measures to ensure the application of the treaties in their national law. It's therefore possible that an internet service provider (ISP) based in a WIPO contracting state, might still respect the DMCA and it's processes.\n",
  "Digital Signature": "A mathematical technique used to validate the authenticity and integrity of a message, software or digital document. As the digital equivalent of a handwritten signature or stamped seal, a digital signature offers far more inherent security, and it is intended to solve the problem of tampering and impersonation in digital communications. Digital signatures can provide the added assurances of evidence of origin, identity and status of an electronic document, transaction or message and can acknowledge informed consent by the signer. In many countries, including the United States, digital signatures are considered legally binding in the same way as traditional document signatures. Digital signatures are based on public key cryptography, also known as asymmetric cryptography. Using a public key algorithm, such as RSA, one can generate two keys that are mathematically linked: one private and one public. Digital signatures work through public key cryptography's two mutually-authenticating cryptographic keys. The individual who is creating the digital signature uses their own private key to encrypt signature-related data; the only way to decrypt that data is with the signer's public key. This is how digital signatures are authenticated. Digital signature technology requires all the parties to trust that the individual creating the signature has been able to keep their own private key secret. If someone else has access to the signer's private key, that party could create fraudulent digital signatures in the name of the private key holder.\n",
  "DigiTrack": "Product of Digible. DigiTrack is where users control their physical card via their platform. Users can choose for it to be stored at DigiSafe or they can sell it or auction it on their platform at a later date, maybe when the card appreciate. Once users sell their physical card, their NFT will get burned to eliminate any duplicate issues.\n",
  "Digix": "An organisation looking to democratise ownership of assets such as gold, to provide everyone with a reliable form of wealth. Digix Gold (DGX) is the first asset-backed token implementation, and Digix is the first commercial issuers of DGX. Every DGX is a fully backed gold token, based on the proprietary Proof of Provenance protocol developed by Digix. They provide a simple web app for customers to purchase gold tokens, which can be used for payments and trading in the crypto ecosystem. Each DGX token represents one gram of gold.\n",
  "Dilution": "Dilution occurs when a company issues new shares that result in a decrease in existing stockholders' ownership percentage of that company. Stock dilution can also occur when holders of stock options, such as company employees, or holders of other optionable securities exercise their options. When the number of shares outstanding increases, each existing stockholder owns a smaller, or diluted, percentage of the company, making each share less valuable.\n\nA share of stock represents equity ownership in that company. When a firm's board of directors decides to take their company public, usually through an initial public offering (IPO), they authorize the number of shares that will be initially offered. This amount of outstanding stock is commonly referred to as the \"float.\" If that company later issues additional stock (often called secondary offerings) they have increased the float and therefore diluted their stock: the shareholders who bought the original IPO now have a smaller ownership stake in the company than they did prior to the new shares being issued.\n",
  "Dinosaur Coins": "Coins that were fan favorites during the 2017 bull market but most of them are essentially dead projects now. For example, things like NEO being touted as the \"Ethereum of China\" and people were very bullish about OmiseGO because its founder had an Apple sticker on his skateboard. On top of that, coins like Ethereum Classic are the best (worst?) of both worlds - it's a dead platform with little to no activity and newer investors are buying it because they believe it is a \"cheaper version of Ethereum.\"\n",
  "DinoSwap": "A multi-chain farming powerhouse that attracts & builds liquidity on existing AMMs.\n",
  "Directed Acyclic Graph": "Used to model probabilities, connectivity, and causality. A “graph” in this sense means a structure made from nodes and edges. Nodes are usually denoted by circles or ovals (although technically they can be any shape of your choosing). Edges are the connections between the nodes.\n",
  "Directional Trading": "Directional trading refers to trading strategies based on the investor’s assessment of the broad market, or a specific security’s, direction. Investors can implement a basic directional trading strategy by taking a long position if the market, or security, is rising, or a short position if the security's price is falling.\n\nDirectional trading is widely associated with options trading since several strategies can be used to capitalize on a move higher, or lower, in the broader market, or a particular stock. While directional trading requires the trader to have a strong conviction about the market, or security’s, near-term direction, the trader also needs to have a risk mitigation strategy in place to protect investment capital if prices move in the direction that is counter to the trader's view.\n\nTypically, directional trading in stocks needs a relatively sizeable move to enable the trader to cover commissions and trading costs, and still make a profit. But with options, because of their leverage, directional trading can be attempted even if the anticipated movement in the underlying stock is not expected to be large.\n",
  "Dirty Higher Order Bits": "Types that do not occupy the full 32 bytes might contain “dirty higher order bits”. This is especially important if you access msg.data - it poses a malleability risk: You can craft transactions that call a function f(uint8 x) with a raw byte argument of 0xff000001 and with 0x00000001. Both are fed to the contract and both will look like the number 1 as far as x is concerned, but msg.data will be different, so if you use keccak256(msg.data) for anything, you will get different results.\n",
  "Discord": "A proprietary freeware instant messaging and VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities ranging from gamers to education and businesses. Often used in cryptocurrency communities.\n",
  "Discounted Cash Flow": "A valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future. This applies to the decisions of investors in companies or securities, such as acquiring a company, investing in a technology startup, or buying a stock, and for business owners and managers looking to make capital budgeting or operating expenditures decisions such as opening a new factory or purchasing or leasing new equipment.\n\nThe present value of expected future cash flows is arrived at by using a discount rate to calculate the DCF. If the DCF is above the current cost of the investment, the opportunity could result in positive returns. Companies typically use the weighted average cost of capital for the discount rate, because it takes into consideration the rate of return expected by shareholders. The DCF has limitations, primarily in that it relies on estimations of future cash flows, which could prove inaccurate.\n",
  "Dispute Time Delay": "The time window, measured in blocks, for an individual to dispute an incorrect state transition in a Fraud Proof protocol. If no Fraud Proof is submitted within the Dispute Time Delay (DTD), the L2 state transition is considered correct. If a Fraud Proof is submitted to the smart contract, and is found correct (i.e., was submitted within the DTD, and indeed proves an incorrect state transition), it results, at a minimum, in the smart contract reverting to the commitment of the last correct L2 state. Additional steps, such as penalties to the violating party, may be applied.\n",
  "Distributed Denial of Service": "A large-scale Denial of Service attack where the perpetrator uses more than one unique IP address or machines, often from thousands of hosts infected with malware. A distributed denial of service attack typically involves more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks; fewer nodes may qualify as a DoS attack but is not a DDoS attack. Since the incoming traffic flooding the victim originates from different sources, it may be impossible to stop the attack simply by using ingress filtering. It also makes it difficult to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic when spread across multiple points of origin. As an alternative or augmentation of a DDoS, attacks may involve forging of IP sender addresses (IP address spoofing) further complicating identifying and defeating the attack.\n",
  "Distributed Ledger Technology": "A database that is consensually shared and synchronized across multiple sites, institutions, or geographies, accessible by multiple people. It allows transactions to have public \"witnesses\". The participant at each node of the network can access the recordings shared across that network and can own an identical copy of it. Any changes or additions made to the ledger are reflected and copied to all participants in a matter of seconds or minutes. It is also called a shared ledger or distributed ledger.\n",
  "Distribution": "The term refers to a large blocks of assets that are carefully sold into the market gradually in smaller blocks so as to inundate the market with sell orders for the security and driving down its price. Traders also refer to the dynamic of securities being sold this way as simply \"distribution.\"\n",
  "district0x": "A collective of marketplaces and communities, which we refer to as districts. Districts exist as decentralized autonomous organizations on the district0x Network. All districts will be built upon a standard open-source framework, d0xINFRA. Modeled after the Ethlance stack, the d0xINFRA framework is comprised of Ethereum smart contracts and front-end libraries. All districts possess the following capabilities required to operate an online market, which are made accessible via list and gallery-style user interfaces: (1) Postings and listings, (2) Search and filtering, (3) Ranking and reputation, and (4) Payments and Invoicing. Each district’s backend logic is controlled by a combination of d0xINFRA contracts shared by all districts on the network and a set of district-specific contracts. d0xINFRA is designed to be open and extendable, allowing districts to implement unique features and enhanced functionality via the plug-in of auxiliary modules.\n",
  "district0x Network Token": "An Ethereum-based token built using the ERC20 standard. This token was created to facilitate participation and coordination in the development of the district0x Network, and eventually the handoff of network governance to the community. It’s also used to signal support or disapproval for proposals made by network participants, and will be staked to deposit pools to mint tokens providing district-specific voting rights in corresponding Aragon entities. The inherent value to any given person will differ depending on the extent of their desire to participate in the network as well as the mechanisms outlined in the district0x whitepaper.\n",
  "Divergence": "Term that refers to the price of an asset moving in the opposite direction of a technical indicator, such as an oscillator, or is moving contrary to other data. Divergence warns that the current price trend may be weakening, and in some cases may lead to the price changing direction. There is positive and negative divergence. Positive divergence indicates a move higher in the price of the asset is possible. Negative divergence signals that a move lower in the asset is possible.\n",
  "Diversification": "A risk management strategy that mixes a wide variety of investments within a portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types and investment vehicles in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The rationale behind this technique is that a portfolio constructed of different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\n",
  "Dividend": "The distribution of some of a company's earnings to a class of its shareholders, as determined by the company's board of directors. Common shareholders of dividend-paying companies are typically eligible as long as they own the stock before the ex-dividend date. Dividends may be paid out as cash or in the form of additional stock. Announcements of dividend payouts are generally accompanied by a proportional increase or decrease in a company's stock price.\n",
  "Dividend Reinvestment Plan": "A program that allows investors to reinvest their cash dividends into additional shares or fractional shares of the underlying stock on the dividend payment date. Although the term can apply to any automatic reinvestment arrangement set up through a brokerage or investment company, it generally refers to a formal program offered by a publicly traded corporation to existing shareholders. Around 650 companies and 500 closed-end funds currently do so.\n",
  "DKA Token": "A utility token that supports overall ecosystem of dKargo's platform.

  "DODO Carnival": "A community distribution and various incentive programs where 60% of the total DODO token supply of DODO Exchange is reserved for the community.\n",
  "DODO Exchange": "A next-generation on-chain liquidity provider, which leverages the Proactive Market Maker algorithm (PMM) to provide pure on-chain and contract-fillable liquidity for everyone. DODO accepts liquidity providers' assets. It gathers funds near market prices to provide sufficient liquidity. In order to minimize counterparty risks for LPs, DODO dynamically adjusts market prices to encourage arbitrageurs to step in and stabilize LPs' portfolios. Features of DODO include low slippage, single risk exposure, and no impermanent loss. DODO is powered by a ground-breaking algorithm called PMM. PMM leverages price oracles to retrieve accurate market prices of assets as input. It then aims to provide sufficient liquidity near the market price for every asset. The result is that liquidity decreases rapidly when far away from the market price. With everything held constant, the PMM curve is significantly flatter than the Automated Market Maker (AMM) curve near the market price, indicating higher fund utilization and lower slippage. Prices provided by PMM are more favorable than AMM.\n",
  "DODO NFT": "Product of DODO Exchange. Pledging NFT (or multiple NFTs) into the DODO NFT Vault will automatically generate an ERC20 token contract. Owners of the DODO NFT Vault can set the percentage of tokens going into the secondary market, and set aside token distributions to the primary market/creative teams/community incentives.\n\nThe DODO NFT Vault automatically creates a DODO Trading Pool and pledges in all FRAG tokens that enter the market. The initial price is defined by the owner of the DODO NFT Vault to start selling FRAG. As traders buy, the FRAG price will automatically increase. The market value of FRAG is the valuation of NFT.\n",
  "DODO Token": "A governance token instrumental to the DODO ecosystem, which, as our long-term roadmap envisioned, will consist of three decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), namely: (1) Admin DAO: This DAO is the highest decision-making authority. It oversees the entire DODO ecosystem and can make changes to how the other two DAOs operate; (2) Risk Control DAO: This DAO is responsible for adjusting and fine-tuning various risk parameters; and (3) Earn DAO: This DAO is tasked with governing how earnings on the DODO platform are distributed. Holding and staking DODO tokens will grant you the right to get involved in governance discussions and decisions. The DODO governance system and structure will be gradually implemented and become available as our platform continues to mature.\n",
  "Dogecoin": "A fun, new and rapidly growing form of digital currency. This form of digital currency is called \"cryptocurrency\"; a type of digital currency. Cryptocurrency is completely anonymous, decentralized, and extremely secure. Dogecoin is used with a wallet on your computer, your smartphone, or a website. You can use it to buy goods and services, or trade it for other currencies (both other cryptocurrencies or traditional currency like US dollars). One of the most popular uses for Dogecoin is \"tipping\" fellow internet-goers who create or share great content. Think of it as a more meaningful \"like\" or upvote, with real value that can be used all across the internet. \"Doge\" is our fun, friendly mascot! The Shiba Inu is a Japanese breed of dog that was popularized as an online meme and represents Dogecoin.\n\n",
  "Dogethereum Bridge": "In December 2015, a bounty emerged to establish both reliable communication and secure transfer of value between the Dogecoin and Ethereum blockchains. This prized \"Dogethereum bridge\" would allow parties to \"lock\" a DOGE coin on Dogecoin and in exchange receive a newly minted WOW token in Ethereum. Any subsequent owner of the WOW token could burn it and, in exchange, earn the right to \"unlock\" a DOGE on Dogecoin. The protocol relies on bulletproofs, Truebit, and parametrized tokens to efficiently and trustlessly relay events from the \"true\" Dogecoin blockchain into Ethereum. The present construction not only enables cross-platform exchange but also allows Ethereum smart contracts to trustlessly access Dogecoin. A similar technique adds Ethereum-based smart contracts to Bitcoin and Bitcoin data to Ethereum smart contracts.\n",

  "Dopex": "A decentralized options protocol which aims to maximize liquidity, minimize losses for option writers and maximize gains for option buyers - all in a passive manner for liquidity contributing participants.\n\nOption pools are created for all options on Dopex, which allows anyone to participate and deposit base/quote for their respective pools to gain passive income from option writing and purchasing discounted options through liquidity pools which could then be arb-ed for an instant profit.\n\nThe protocol is governed by users via a limited supply governance token, DPX, which would also be used for collecting protocol and app layer fees.\n\nDopex also offers a rebate system for losses incurred for option writers based on exercised options for every epoch. The rebates are paid in the form of a theoretically infinite supply token, rDPX. \n\nRebates are calculated based on percentage losses incurred by option writers for an epoch and a percentage of rDPX relative to the value of losses incurred are minted and distributed to option pool participants. The percentage rebate is determined by a governance process based on votes by DPX holders within the protocol. \n\nThe rebate allows for option writers to gain a superior return in comparison to writing naked options or hedged option writing strategies of any sort. \n\nrDPX can in the future, also be used as collateral to borrow capital from the margin pool to leverage option positions or to mint synthetic derivatives of assets supported within the protocol such as - cryptocurrencies, stocks, ETFs, commodities, currencies etc.\n\nThis inherently gives the rDPX token real value and creates a positive feedback loop for liquidity to grow and option writers/traders to participate considering the deep liquidity, cheaper options to purchase and higher ROI from option writing.\n",
  "dOrg": "A full-stack freelancer agency building and running itself on web3. Jobs and their requirements are listed on the website. Selected work include Gnosis, The Graph, DAOstack, DeversiFi, Balancer, and etoro. \n",
  "DoS with Failed Call": "External calls can fail accidentally or deliberately, which can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) condition in the contract. To minimize the damage caused by such failures, it is better to isolate each external call into its own transaction that can be initiated by the recipient of the call. This is especially relevant for payments, where it is better to let users withdraw funds rather than push funds to them automatically (this also reduces the chance of problems with the gas limit).\n",
  "Dose of DeFi": "Newsletter covering DeFi happenings. Authored by Chris Powers.\n",
  "DOT Coin": "The native cryptocurrency of the Polkadot blockchain protocol.

  "Double-spending": "The risk that a digital currency can be spent twice. It is a potential problem unique to digital currencies because digital information can be reproduced relatively easily by savvy individuals who understand the blockchain network and the computing power necessary to manipulate it. Physical currencies do not have this issue because they cannot be easily replicated, and the parties involved in a transaction can immediately verify the authenticity and past ownership of the physical currency. That is of course excluding matters involving cash transactions.\n",

The DJIA was designed to serve as a proxy for the health of the broader U.S. economy.\n",
  "Downtrend": "A term that refers to the price action of a security that moves lower in price as it fluctuates over time. While the price may move intermittently higher or lower, downtrends are characterized by lower peaks and lower troughs over time. Technical analysts pay attention to downtrends because they represent something more than a random losing streak. Securities in a downtrend seem to be more likely to continue trending lower until some market condition changes, implying that a downtrend marks a fundamentally deteriorating condition.\n",
  "dPoll": "A decentralized polling DApp where poll creators can get instant feedback from pollers.\n",

DUCK token holders will be able to stake their tokens to participate in governance and collect protocol fees. The team is working on the governance pool, but the infrastructure is not ready yet. Before it is operational, all the allocated fees will be used to buyout DUCK from the open market and burn it. Future changes in fee distribution are subject to governance decisions. Eventually, community engagement will help Unit protocol userbase grow faster, becoming a more decentralized ecosystem. It will provide better adoption, security, and utility of Unit protocol.\n",
  "DuckDAO": "A decentralized incubator that helps promising projects achieve their full potential by leveraging the investment power and buzz making potential of our community. We aim to democratize access to investment opportunities that were previously available only to well-heeled investors and venture funds, opening up the closed ecosystem of early-stage crypto project investments to everybody. DuckDAO looks to break the cycle of early-stage investments in high-potential cryptocurrency projects, which typically see large traditional VCs buy out stacks of tokens in strategic, seed, and private sale investment rounds at far lower prices than retail investors got during the public sale. These VCs would then dump their holdings on retail investors to secure an easy profit, while simultaneously damaging sentiment surrounding the project. Instead, we believe in cultivating long-term partnerships with the projects we support, helping to establish healthy, natural growth that builds lasting success.\n",

  "dYdX": "A decentralized trading platform that currently supports margin trading, spot trading, lending, and borrowing. The platform runs on smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, and allows users to trade with no intermediaries. The platform is non-custodial, meaning that user funds are held either in their own wallets or in a smart contract, which is a program that runs on the Ethereum Blockchain. The protocol does not have any user accounts (and does not require any formal sign-up). Instead, you can instantly use dYdX by using your own Ethereum wallet to send transactions to the blockchain. Interest rates are \"floating,\" which mean that they are dynamic and updated instantly depending on demand. This also means that rates are never \"locked-in\" at the time of opening a position and may change over the course of it being open. There are separate rates for borrowing and lending per asset. The rates move based on utilization, which is the ratio of \"amount borrowed\" to \"amount lent.\" As utilization increases, the interest rate will increase to incentivize more lenders. As utilization decreases, the interest rate decreases. Interest is paid continuously, so that you can close a position or withdraw funds at any time without worrying about a lock-up period. This also means that interest is continuously-compounding and all rates are in APR (with a higher percentage in APY).\n",
  "Dynamic Market Maker": "An on-chain automated liquidity protocol that uses programmable pricing curves to try to improve capital efficiency from the constant product formula pioneered by Uniswap. Similar to Uniswap, it removes the need for trusted intermediaries, and prioritizes decentralization and security.\n\nDynamic Market Maker's (DMM's) core improvements are its flexible fee adjustment and programmable pricing curve setups. The flexible fee approach helps reduce the impact of impermanent loss, while different pricing curve setups tailored particularly to the token pairs in the pool allows better capital efficiency.\n\nAnyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) to a DMM pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for LP tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves, and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.\n\nFor each token pair, there are possibly many multiple pools with different configurations for the pricing curve. Pools are ready to accept one token for the other as long as the DMM formula is preserved.\n\nThe DMM applies a dynamic fee to trades, which is added to reserves. This functions as a payout to LPs, which is realized when they burn their LP tokens to withdraw their portion of total reserves. For more information on dynamic fees, see Dynamic Fee.\n",

  "Edge Caching Technology": "Technology of Filebase. All free and paid Filebase customers have access to their Filebase Edge Caching Technology, which helps to make uploads and downloads highly-performant when compared to fetching and retrieving data directly from decentralized networks.\n\nFilebase provides access to decentralized storage through its unique edge platform. These storage networks impose fees upon their users when retrieving data. As a result, Filebase must charge customers for outbound bandwidth when downloads are performed. \n\nHowever, it is their goal at Filebase to help minimize these charges. As a result, they deploy an aggressive caching layer at their edge locations. If a recently or frequently accessed object is downloaded from their service, there is a high probability that this object will be cached in their edge layer. If data is cached on their edge, users don't pay for any bandwidth. This caching layer serves a few benefits. If an object is cached, the following will be true:\n\n The Filebase customer is not charged for egress (bandwidth)\n The download performance is significantly increased\n If frequently accessed, the object will remain active in the cache for 7 days\n If an edge node is busy, it is possible for objects that have gone dormant to be evicted\n The x-cache-status HTTP header will return a value of HIT. Objects that are not cached will return MISS.\n",

  "Efficient Market Hypothesis": "The efficient market hypothesis (EMH), alternatively known as the efficient market theory, is a hypothesis that states that share prices reflect all information and consistent alpha generation is impossible. According to the EMH, stocks always trade at their fair value on exchanges, making it impossible for investors to purchase undervalued stocks or sell stocks for inflated prices. Therefore, it should be impossible to outperform the overall market through expert stock selection or market timing, and the only way an investor can obtain higher returns is by purchasing riskier investments.\n",

  "EIP-1559": "Every transaction on Ethereum carries at least some benefit and some cost. It is assumed that every transaction delivers some benefit to a user or it wouldn't be made. It is also assumed that at least some costs are necessary to protect the network. The main cost to users is in the form of transaction fees, also known as gas fees\". As Ethereum has grown more popular, users have reported difficulty estimating the optimal gas fees, along with difficulty avoiding unexpectedly long delays.\n\nThe source of frustration with the current fee system stems primarily from Ethereum's attempt to price fees using a simple auction mechanism. Known as a first price auction, this system works by having everyone submit their bid (gas price) for how much they're willing to pay to have their transaction picked up by a miner. Usually, miners select transactions ranked by the highest fees which results in many users grossly overpaying. Had they known what others were bidding, they could avoid making bids that were much higher than necessary. In many cases, users can see a large divergence of transaction fees paid by different users in a single block, suggesting that many users often overpay by more than 5x.\n\nIn 2018, a new solution (EIP-1559) was proposed by Vitalik Buterin. The idea is to start with a BASEFEE amount which is adjusted up and down by the protocol based on how congested the network is. To accommodate this system, the network capacity would be increased to 16 million gas, so that 50% utilization matches up with the current 8 million gas limit. Then, when the network is at >50% capacity, the BASEFEE increments up slightly and when capacity is at <50%, it decrements down slightly. Because these increments are constrained, the maximum difference in BASEFEE from block to block is predictable. This then allows wallets to auto-set the gas fees for users in a highly reliable fashion. It is expected that most users will not have to manually adjust gas fees, even in periods of high network activity. For most users, the BASEFEE will be automatically set by their wallet, along with the addition of a small fixed amount, called a 'tip', to compensate miners (e.g. 0.5 gwei).\n\nAn important aspect of this upgraded fee system is that miners only get to keep the tips. The BASEFEE is always burned (i.e. it is destroyed by the protocol). Burning this is important because it prevents miners from manipulating the fee in order to extract more fees from users. It also ensures that only ETH can ever be used to pay for transactions on Ethereum, cementing the economic value of ETH within the Ethereum platform.\n",
  "Elastic Farming": "The concept of changing the farm token dynamically according to a given formula. There will be an increase or decrease in the farm token distribution depending on the price of the token. The amount of the farm tokens given out will increase if the token value decreases as to incentivise LPs to provide liquidity. This amount will be floor at a certain no of tokens as to not create a negative feedback loop. If the token value increases the team will decrease the amount of farm tokens in such a way that the value distributed tokens will also increase. This encourages the positive feedback loop as there is less inflation if the value of CNT tokens is under x well will provide a number of tokens a day in farms.\n",

Users can purchase ETH, BTC, USDC, and DAI at a discount without being locked into a term, allowing the exchange of the discounted asset and the base asset at any time. The fixed rate income can be secured with the exchange of any major base asset. For active DeFi users, the Element Protocol provides capital efficiency on yield positions they are already depositing into, such as Yearn or ETH2 staking. Users can sell their deposited principal at a discount as fixed yield income, leveraging or increasing exposure to yield without liquidation risk. This competitive activity is what drives the high fixed yield markets.\n",

  "Eloncity": "Project that decentralizes our power infrastructure into millions of self sufficient microgrids. In the ELONCITY ecosystem, the energy consumers play a critical role in the planning and implementation of their energy future. The blockchain smart contract platform and crypto utility token enables energy consumers to exchange locally produced energy, creating cost-benefit incentives for energy asset deployment within their communities. Decentralized renewable energy is about employing naturally available renewable resources, such as solar or wind power, to produce electricity locally, where and when it is consumed. When energy consumers in a community collaborate with each other to exchange energy, this, in turn, allows them to equitably allocate the costs-benefits of shared energy equipment to create community-wide access to safe, secure, reliable and cost-effective, local energy supplies. Furthermore, this opens the door to maximize utilization rates of the shared energy equipment, and accelerate equipment purchasers’ return-on-investment (ROI). The result is a community-based renewable microgrid (CRM) that can operate in grid-connected or stand-alone mode. This type of decentralized CRM holds the potential to support local economic growth, by providing universal access to reliable and affordable electricity.\n",
  "Elrond Network": "A distributed transactional computation protocol which relies on a sharded state architecture and a secure Proof of Stake consensus mechanism. While most other blockchain networks require custom hardware and high energy consumption, Elrond runs on average computers. By employing sharding, a method of parallelizing data & transactions processing, Elrond's performance will scale up with the number of computers joining the network, reaching more than 100.000 transactions per second while growing increasingly decentralized.\n\nThe Elrond network is the first to present a viable solution where all the three aspects of sharding - state, network and transactions - have been implemented at once. Combined with its \"Adaptive\" component, this novel architecture allows for dynamic network configuration to maintain a high level of security while scaling with demand. In addition to scaling through sharding, Elrond also approaches the consensus problem with a mechanism called Secure Proof of Stake, which mitigates potential attack vectors when compared to Proof of Work, while also enabling large throughput and fast execution. By solving some of the hardest consensus and sharding problems in the blockchain space, Elrond is able to provide a very high level of performance on a network made of inexpensive computers, resulting in a very low cost per transaction. In addition to performance and cost, Elrond also stands out through the quality of the developer experience and the resulting boost in usability on the end-user side.\n",

The only way to trigger Emergency Shutdown in Single Collateral Dai is for MKR voters to pass an Executive Vote. For Multi-collateral Dai, there are two primary ways that an Emergency Shutdown could be triggered. One way is through the Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM), which allows for a shutdown to be triggered by a minimum number of MKR called the Emergency Shutdown Threshold. Emergency Shutdown may also be triggered through a regular Executive Vote, though the ESM would be a more direct method that does not have to wait for the delay period imposed by the Governance Security Module.\n",

For technical reasons, an encryption scheme usually uses a pseudo-random encryption key generated by an algorithm. It is possible to decrypt the message without possessing the key, but, for a well-designed encryption scheme, considerable computational resources and skills are required. An authorized recipient can easily decrypt the message with the key provided by the originator to recipients but not to unauthorized users. Historically, various forms of encryption have been used to aid in cryptography.\n",

  "Equalizer": "A protocol that specializes in flash lending. Flash lending is a revolutionary financial product unique to the decentralized finance world as it has no corresponding centralized finance product or service. It allows the borrower to take a loan, use it for profitable operations, and return it together with interest within the same blockchain transaction. Through its nature, flash lending adds more depth to the concept of democratized finance by allowing everybody to act as a significant player in the field for any given instance, using up to the total liquidity available on a platform.\n\nFlash lending is risk-free for liquidity vaults and strengthens the concept of democratized finance as it allows the borrowers to use the entire available capital of the vaults. Hence, operations that were available only to a small group of entities with many funds become available to everyone.\n\nEqualizer represents the first dedicated platform for flash lending, while currently on the market, they find only platforms that offer flash loans as a side product, along with decentralized borrowing and other financial products. This allows for unprecedented levels of performance and unique value propositions across the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nTheir business model is based on a single core service: providing a secure and reliable platform for flash loans. By offering a tailor-made service needed to create a strong foundation, they aspire to become a solid building block of the Decentralized Finance market.\n\nEqualizer will become the foundational component of DeFi that equalizes and stabilizes the decentralized markets, making DeFi more resilient. Equalizer will become a tool at the base of DeFi that can be used and integrated with other products and services in the DeFi industry.\n\nTheir vision at Equalizer is that decentralized finance is ushering in a new era of innovation and business opportunities, from which everybody can profit. They will become a core ecosystem player through their dedicated flash lending platform, generating value for all stakeholders.\n",
  "Equilibrium": "A decentralized cross-chain money market protocol on Polkadot. Users can lend out assets and earn interest; provide liquidity to cover potential borrower losses, and earn a yield on it; borrow assets for trading, leveraging, hedging, and so on using collateral and paying interest; and exchange crypto assets and trade on margin.\n\nEquilibrium's Substrate will become a Polkadot parachain that hosts a multi-purpose money market protocol, letting users to lend and borrow stablecoins and crypto assets, as well as protect system debt and earn fees in return.\n\nThe design of Equilibrium's protocol and Polkadot's underlying technology allow for the creation of the first leveraged, interoperable decentralized exchange.\n\nEquilibrium uses novel approaches to on-chain pricing (interest rate calculation) and risk calculations (determination of overall system health), which sets Equilibrium apart from other well-known known DeFi projects in several ways:\n\n There are no arbitrary governance-set interest rates. They are determined by a borrower’s portfolio, borrower debt, overall system liquidity, and the market's risks and dynamics.\n\n There are no arbitrarily set LTV requirements. The system makes sure every position remains solvent at a 100% collateralization ratio.\n\n There are no arbitrarily set liquidation penalties, and no hidden fees when borrowers default on their loan.\n\n There are always two sides to the system, by design: lenders and bailsmen are the liquidity providers on one side, and borrowers live on the other side, paying fees to lenders and bailsmen.\n\nThe Equilibrium assets module supports:\n\n1. asset lending.\n2. fractional reserve system and synthetic asset creation.\n3. an exchange that lets users engage in leveraged trading.\n4. portfolio hedging.\n\nThe Assets module logic lets Equilibrium introduce a broad line of DeFi products within one blockchain, practically out of the box.\n\n The thought-out design of Polkadot’s consensus and finality mechanisms guarantees the security of the Equilibrium substrate on the blockchain level. Approximately 20 validators manage the Equilibrium parachain with a NPoS consensus and GRANDPA finality.\n\n Equilibrium achieves cross-chain compatibility by way of Polkadot’s integration of third party bridges to different blockchains. We are working closely with several prominent Polkadot bridges to the ETH and BTC blockchains to bridge liquidity into Equilibrium.\n",
  "Equity Token": "Tokens that function more like a traditional stock asset. In other words, equity token holders possess some form of ownership in their investments. Their tokens represent how much ownership percentage they actually have. In most instances, equity tokens represent a third-party asset, property, or venture. Equity tokens come in many forms: (1) Stocks, (2) Futures, (3) Options Contracts, (4) Tokenized Real Estate, or (5) Tokenized Ventures.\n",
  "Erasure Protocol": "Erasure Protocol is a decentralized data marketplace for predictions which allows users to upload predictions and build reputation over time by staking cryptocurrencies like Numeraire (NMR) or DAI to show their confidence in their data or prediction.\n",
  "ERC-20": "A technical standard used to issue and implement tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The standard describes a common set of rules that should be followed for a token to function properly within the Ethereum ecosystem. Therefore, ERC-20 should not be considered as a piece of code or software. Instead, it may be described as a technical guideline or specification. The ERC-20 standard reduced significantly the efforts required to create and issue a digital token, and this is probably related to the raising interest in ICO crowdfunding events and blockchain technology as a whole. Several projects are already using the technical standard, and the number of ERC-20 token contracts has grown drastically in the last couple of years. In mid-2017, there were around 5,500 ERC-20 smart contracts on the Ethereum network. In early 2018, this number grew to over 40,000 and is now more than 160,000. \n",
  "ERC-721": "A free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique. Think of them like rare, one-of-a-kind collectables. \n\nERC-721 defines a minimum interface a smart contract must implement to allow unique tokens to be managed, owned, and traded. It does not mandate a standard for token metadata or restrict adding supplemental functions.\n",
  "ERC-792": "The ERC-792 - Arbitration Standard describes a standard of Arbitrable and Arbitrator contracts. Every Arbitrable contract can be adjudicated by every Arbitrator contract. Arbitrator contracts give rulings and Arbitrable contracts enforce them. Using two contracts allows separation between the ruling and its enforcement. This abstraction allows Arbitrable contract developers not to have to know the internal process of the Arbitrator contracts. Neither do Arbitrator contract developers with Arbitrable ones. It allows dapps to easily switch from one arbitration service to another one. Or to allow their users to choose themselves their arbitration services.\n",
  "ERC-1257": "A Proof of Payment Standard created by the Kyber Network team. The motivation is to have some form of standardization of the record of payment made. Without a unified standard for proof of payment, collaboration and development of important tools such as accounting applications and payment libraries become difficult. The standard helps to make it easier to track smart contract payments and removes the need for multiple deposit addresses.\n",
  "ERC-1404": "A simple restricted Token Standard that helps token issuers to manage their compliance requirements. Allows token issuers to know who their token holders are at all times and maintain a whitelist of investor addresses. It also allows token issuers to enforce complex transfer restrictions such as (1) enacting a preventative poison pill provision, to restrict the maximum ownership of a single individual or entity; (2) the ability to prevent token holders in a single jurisdiction to trade with token holders in another jurisdiction; and (3) the ability for the issuer to revoke a token if necessary.\n",
  "ERC-1497": "An evidence standard for arbitration. It describes the standards for MetaEvidence and Evidence for dispute resolution. Evidence is provided by a participant in a dispute in order to support their assertion. MetaEvidence gives context to the dispute so that arbitrators are able to accurately and fairly evaluate it.

  "Ether": "Digital, global money and currency of Ethereum apps. ETH is the lifeblood of Ethereum. When users send ETH or use an Ethereum application, they have to pay a small fee in ETH to use the Ethereum network. This fee is an incentive for a miner to process and verify what the user is trying to do. ETH will become even more important with staking in Ethereum 2. When users stake their ETH, they will be able to help secure Ethereum and earn rewards. In this system, the threat of losing your ETH disincentivises attacks. \n\nThe Ethereum community is also building a whole financial system that's peer-to-peer and accessible to everyone. ETH holders can use ETH as collateral to generate entirely different cryptocurrency tokens on Ethereum. They can also borrow, lend and earn interest on ETH and other ETH-backed tokens.\n\nETH is valuable in different ways to different people. For users of Ethereum, ETH is valuable because it lets them pay transaction fees. Others see it as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over time. More recently, ETH has become valuable to users of financial apps on Ethereum. That's because they can use ETH as collateral for crypto loans, or as a payment system. Of course many also see it as an investment, similar to Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n",
  "Ethereum": "An open-ended, decentralized, blockchain-based, public software platform that facilitates peer-to-peer contracts, known as Smart Contracts, as well as Decentralized Applications, known as DApps. \n\nSmart contracts allow users to exchange value without requiring an intermediary. Smart contracts are agreements with defined terms and protocols in place to enforce them. But unlike traditional contracts, written in human languages and enforced by courts of law, smart contracts are written in code that a computer can execute, which eliminates ambiguity. The Ethereum network acts as a single decentralized computer that runs the smart contract code. This means that all computers participating in the Ethereum network will come to consensus on the outcome of each smart contract. \n\nTraditional software applications often rely on central authorities to store data and perform operations on that data. This requires trust in the central authority. DApps can make use of smart contracts on the Ethereum network to achieve decentralization. Smart contracts can store data. The Ethereum network enforces that all operations on the data happen according to the smart contract code. In other words, the data maintains its integrity without a central trusted party. \n\nEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. It is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, after Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most actively used blockchain in the world. Ethereum is used for decentralized finance, and has been utilized for many initial coin offerings.\n\nEthereum is currently planning to implement a series of upgrades called Ethereum 2.0, which includes a transition to proof of stake and an increase in transaction throughput using sharding.\n",

Any operation in the EVM consumes CPU cycles, disk access, memory, of the hosting machine (which carries a cost). This cost is paid via Ethereum 'gas'. The code in Ethereum contracts is written in a low-level, stack-based bytecode language, referred to as \"Ethereum virtual machine code\" or \"EVM code\". The code consists of a series of bytes, where each byte represents an operation. In general, code execution is an infinite loop that consists of repeatedly carrying out the operation at the current program counter (which begins at zero) and then incrementing the program counter by one, until the end of the code is reached or an error or STOP or RETURN instruction is detected.\n",

  "Exchange": "Businesses that allow customers to trade cryptocurrencies for fiat money or other cryptocurrencies. Also called Cryptocurrency Exchanges or Digital Currency Exchanges.\n",
  "Exchange Flows": "A metric used by traders. If market participants are bearish and worried that the value of their crypto holdings may drop, they would try to sell down their holdings via exchanges. Net exchange flows is a metric that displays this trend; it measures the net amount of tokens coming into/out of exchanges. If there has been a sudden uptick in net inflows of a particular token into exchanges, it could imply that participants are trying to exit that asset by selling them on exchanges, and vice versa.\n",
  "Exchange Traded Fund": "An investment fund traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value, although deviations can occasionally occur. Most ETFs track an index, such as a stock index or bond index. ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, tax efficiency, and stock-like features.\n",

Earnings are distributed fairly and the platform provides gamers honest rewards and control over their earnings.\n",
  "Exit Scam": "A fraudulent practice by unethical cryptocurrency promoters who vanish with investors’ money during or after an ICO. The modus operandi is simple – promoters launch a new cryptocurrency platform based on a promising concept; the ICO then raises money from various investors; the business may or may not run for some time; and then the promoters who had collected the ICO money disappear, leaving the investors in the lurch. Due to the decentralized, anonymous and regulation-free operations of the virtual currency ecosystem, it is difficult to trace scammers who dupe the investors.\n",
  "Experimental Language Features": "Avoid experimental language features, as these are not properly tested and have contained vulnerabilities in the past.\n",
  "Explain Like I’m 5": "A request for a simple explanation to a complicated question or problem. The 5 refers to a five-year-old child, the implication being that the person requesting the explanation has a limited or naive understanding of the issue. Explain Like I'm 5 comes from the name of the subreddit r/explainlikeimfive. This subreddit was created by the user bossgalaga in September 2011—about a month after ELI5 was entered into Urban Dictionary, and two months after the term first appears on Twitter by user @NinkiCZ. However, bossgalaga got an idea for a new subreddit that would be a \"friendly\" place to ask questions without fear of being mocked if they were deemed obvious or stupid, as can be the case on Reddit. Bossgalaga's idea got a lot of positive feedback, and r/explainlikeimfive quickly became one of Reddit's most popular boards. By early 2019, r/explainlikeimfive was ranked as the 17th most popular subreddit on the entire site, with over 16 million subscribers.\n",
  "Exploitable": "A contract is exploitable if it is vulnerable and the vulnerability could be exploited by an external attacker. For example, if the \"vulnerability\" flagged by a tool is in a function which requires to own the contract, it would be vulnerable but not exploitable.\n",
  "Exploited": "A contract is exploited if it received a transaction on Ethereum's main network which triggered one of its vulnerabilities. Therefore, a contract can be vulnerable or even exploitable without having been exploited.\n",
  "Exponential Moving Average ": "A first-order infinite impulse response filter that applies weighting factors which decrease exponentially. The weighting for each older datum decreases exponentially, never reaching zero.\n",
  "External Calls without Gas Stipends": "In some cases, developers may want to make a transfer and continue execution regardless of the result. One way to achieve this is with call.value(v)(), however this may allow the recipient to consume all the gas of the calling function, preventing execution from continuing.\n",
  "External Contract Referencing": "One of the benefits of the Ethereum global computer is the ability to re-use code and interact with contracts already deployed on the network. As a result, a large number of contracts reference external contracts and in general operation use external message calls to interact with these contracts. These external message calls can mask malicious actors' intentions in some cases.\n",
  "External functions": "Functions that could be invoked from the outside and through transactions as well.\n",
  "Externally Owned Accounts": "One of two account types in Ethereum. \n\nAn externally controlled account:\n\n has an ether balance,\n can send transactions (ether transfer or trigger contract code),\n is controlled by private keys,\n has no associated code.\n",

The game centres around the collection and trading of unique Cars, Drivers and Components – all of which exist as non-fungible tokens (NFTs) based on the ERC-721 token standard. Fungible Tokens (FTs) based on the ERC-20 token standard function as a currency in the game, and can be used in transactions such as paying entry fees and purchasing certain items.\n",
  "Fabrx": "A cloud company for Web3. Products include the Stratosphere Network (a distributed network of cloud service nodes, secured by a proof of stake blockchain), comprehensive Web3 analytics for DApps, issuance of non-fungible tokens as a rewards program, or the integration of open finance into customers' platforms.\n",
  "Factory": "A factory contract is an ethereum smart contract that creates and deploys \"child\" smart contracts. The child smart contracts are sometimes referred to as assets. The factory contract itself will store the address information about the created children contracts so there is a relationship connecting the two in the Ethereum blockchain and a way to track the assets of the factory contract.\n\nIn Uniswap v3, all new pools that are created are child contracts of the Uniswap factory contract. In Uniswap v2, there was only one child smart contract for each pool. However, in Uniswap v3, there will be three fee tiers for each pool so the Uniswap v3 factory will create three child contracts for each pool.\n",
  "Fair Launch Capital": "At its core, the Fair Launch enables founders to quickly get to market, while skipping the traditional fundraise and improving token distribution. For users, Fair Launches enable anyone to participate, creating new conditions for self-governing communities. So here we have a fundamentally disruptive way to bring new protocols to market, that both sides of the market (founders and users) want.\n",
  "Fair Sequencing Service": "An idea in Chainlink Labs that can help make transaction ordering fair in decentralized (and even centralized) systems. It can help resolve the ordering problems in rollups and DeFi more generally. In fact, it takes aim simultaneously at the problems of both high gas costs and unfair transaction ordering. It’s called the Fair Sequencing Service (FSS). FSS provides benefits to any contract written to use it. Contracts can benefit from FSS without any changes to the layer-1 blockchain on which they run. In a nutshell, the idea behind FSS is to have an oracle network order the transactions sent to a particular contract SC, including both user transactions and oracle reports. Oracle nodes ingest transactions and then reach consensus on their ordering, rather than allowing a single leader to dictate it. Oracle nodes then forward the transactions to the contract SC. They sequence these transactions by attaching nonce or sequence numbers to them or sending them in batches.\n",
  "FairSpin": "A lottery that picks multiple winners and creates a fair distribution of collected funds. As of today the lottery business is not transparent, fair and immutable as funds that come in and go out of the centralized pool are untraceable and unverifiable.

  "Fakeout": "A term used in technical analysis to refer to a situation in which a trader enters into a position in anticipation of a future transaction signal or price movement, but the signal or movement never develops and the asset moves in the opposite direction.\n",
  "Falling Knife": "A colloquial term for a rapid drop in the price or value of a security. The term is commonly used in phrases like, \"don't try to catch a falling knife,\" which can be translated to mean, \"wait for the price to bottom out before buying it.\" A falling knife can quickly rebound - in what's known as a whipsaw—or the security may lose all of its value, as in the case of a bankruptcy.\n",
  "Fangible": "The open NFT marketplace of the new generation powered by Bounce. With Binance Smart Chain as the primary chain of the platform, Fangible will shortly be introducing the ability to mint NFTs on multiple chains including Ethereum and Huobi ECO Chain. Users of Fangible will also be able to access these features via a mobile version.\n\nFocused on the ease of use and smooth user journey for artists, Fangible aims to create a Shopify-like experience for NFTs with the lowest fees on the market. Compared with V1, V2 adopts a more artistic and clear UI design with a great leap in processing speed, offering a smoother and more enjoyable user experience. Meanwhile, mobile optimization is another highlight of V2, marking that Fangible users now can have access to NFT collectibles minting and trading at their fingertips. The second release of the platform featuring new market and brand pages, as well as two auction types, is taking us one step closer to this goal.\n\nV2 also brings emphasis to the identification of our NFT artists by introducing the Follow function and soon we will also integrate a verification system to demonstrate special status of some recognized artists.\n\nFangible has been committed to creating an open marketplace where everyone can easily mint and buy NFT items, but as the market is now focusing more on the investment value behind NFT items, it is also their task to build a channel that gets outstanding artists and valuable NFTs in front of investors. With the above-mentioned features integrated, Fangible artists will be earning more clout, which will also be conducive to the platform's development.\n\nFangible positions itself in the collectible trading market in the current stage and it now supports two NFT formats, video and image. They will scale to more formats and fields in the future, as their mission to promote the free trading of a digital world will stay unchanged.\n",

  "Farms-as-a-Service": "Terminology created by Value DeFi. In line with their mission to make DeFi accessible for everyone, Value DeFi created Farms-as-a-Service (FaaS) to allow new projects to easily deploy their contracts instead of having to spend time on forking and deploying the associated contracts the relevant contracts. With Value Liquid's Farming Pool Creation UI, teams can now create the desired customized liquidity pools and pairs along with flexible ratios, customizable fees, and token contract minter approval for the Liquidity Pool with a couple of clicks. An example would be a pool with USDC/New token 67/23 ratio with a 0.60% swap fee that has token minting per block like Sushiswap. This is free and allows anyone to bootstrap their new project making it more accessible. As these projects use the FaaS Smart Contract, common rugpull methods are prevented as there are no backdoors implemented in these Smart Contracts by the Value DeFi team. But there are other ways to exit scam, therefore only whitelisted projects which are checked by the Value DeFi Security team, can be fully trusted. With our new FaaS technology, liquidity providers for these projects will automatically receive the farming token after providing their liquidity at the Farming Pool (gone are the times of putting your Liquidity into Uniswap and after that in a pool using the Smart Contract of the team (that could possibly rugpull by using an implemented backdoor). This makes the process of farming more easy, efficient and safe & secure. As there are less steps to perform and the LP tokens stay within the Smart Contract made by the Value DeFi team, which ensures that there are no backdoors.\n",
  "FarmTogether": "A no-loss yield farming strategic role-playing game (RPG). Essentially Harvest Moon game, but user's enter into a farming tournament where in-game crop yields garner rewards earned through AAVE. It uses Chainlink’s VRF, Alarm Clock, and AAVE.

Assets and liabilities always net to zero across the Notional system.\n",
  "Fear & Greed Index": "A popular metric to gauge sentiment levels in the crypto market is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index. In most markets, participants tend to be emotional with their behavior. Market participants often get overly greedy (FOMO) when prices are on a euphoric rise, whilst they also tend to be overly fearful when prices are down (and irrationally selling their positions at a loss).\n\nThe Fear & Greed Index is an index that tracks the current sentiment of the Bitcoin market from several sources, namely:\n\n# Volatility: measuring current volatility and max. drawdowns of BTC relative to average values in the last 30 days and 90 days\n\n# Market momentum / volume: measuring current volume and market momentum relative to average values in the last 30 days and 90 days (measuring the market’s overreaction)\n\n# Social media: no. of posts with the Bitcoin hashtag and their interaction rate\n\n# Bitcoin dominance: rising dominance tends to be caused by a fear / sell-off in higher risk alt-coins\n\n# Google Trends: search volumes for positive/ negative searches of Bitcoin\n\nThe index starts from zero to 100, with zero meaning “Extreme Fear” (a potential bottom signal as investors are overly worried), and 100 meaning “Extreme Greed” (a potential top signal as investors are overly bullish).  \n\nHistorically, the Fear & Greed Index has been a good indicator of market bottoms; for instance, the index hovered at around the 10-20 range (Extreme Fear) for roughly 3-4 weeks during the ‘18-’19 bear market bottom as well as the COVID-19 crash bottom.\n",
  "Fear Of Missing Out": "The idea of future gains being imminent, and a desire to invest with  more haste and less caution than one would otherwise consider.\n",

  "Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation": "An independent federal agency insuring deposits in U.S. banks and thrifts in the event of bank failures. The FDIC was created in 1933 to maintain public confidence and encourage stability in the financial system through the promotion of sound banking practices. As of 2020, the FDIC insures deposits up to $250,000 per depositor as long as the institution is a member firm. It is critical for consumers to confirm if their institution is FDIC insured.\n\nThe primary purpose of the FDIC is to prevent \"run on the bank\" scenarios, which devastated many banks during the Great Depression. For example, with the threat of the closure of a bank, small groups of worried customers rushed to withdraw their money. After fears spread, a stampede of customers, seeking to do the same, ultimately resulted in banks being unable to support withdrawal requests. Those who were first to withdraw their money from a troubled bank would benefit, whereas those who waited risked losing their savings overnight. Before the FDIC, there was no guarantee for the safety of deposits beyond the confidence in the bank's stability.\n",
  "Fee Structure": "How much does it cost to buy cryptocurrency (crypto) at exchanges? Crypto exchanges charge fees on different types of user behavior. This is called the fee structure. The primary source of revenue for an exchange is a trading fee. It is charged on fiat with crypto as well as crypto with crypto trades. The fee is charged when the order is processed. Generally, the fee ranges from 0% to 0.30% of the total value of the order.\n\nThe fee structure at crypto exchanges also includes charges on deposits and withdrawals. Deposit fees are less common than withdrawal fees since exchanges want to increase their reach.\n\nSome exchanges also offer crypto margin trading, enabling users or liquidity providers to borrow additional funds. In return, these exchanges charge additional fees based on the amount borrowed.\n\nFor example, Uniswap currently has a 0.3% fee for each exchange of tokens. So everytime Alice decides to exchange her tokens using this platform -let’s say she has some UNI she wants to exchange for ETH- she has to pay fees. At the same time, these fees can also serve as a way to provide her and other users with enough funds to enable other processes that require liquidity, like taking a credit.\n",
  "Fee Tokens": "Tokens which have a cryptographically verifiable claim on fees generated by a DeFi protocol.\n",
  "fees.wtf": "Website that shows how much gas an Ethereum wallet has spent on fees.\n",
  "Fei Protocol": "A Decentralized, Fair, Liquid, and Scalable Stablecoin Platform. The goal of the Fei Protocol is to maintain a liquid market in which ETH/FEI trades closely to the ETH/USD price. FEI achieves this via a new stability mechanism known as direct incentives. Direct incentive stablecoins use dynamic mint rewards and burn penalties on DEX trade volume to maintain the peg. FEI uses Uniswap as its incentivized DEX at launch. Governance can add and update DEX integrations and other incentives as needed.\n\nThe mission of Fei Protocol is to create an entirely decentralized stablecoin. Therefore it is critical that no tokens issued by trusted third-parties (e.g. USDC, USDT, wBTC) be used as collateral on the bonding curve. This is a stance the development team hopes will be shared by the governance community post-launch.\n",
  "FEI token": "FEI is the pegged stablecoin produced by Fei Protocol, following the ERC-20 standard. Its supply is uncapped. Minter and Burner contracts control its issuance, via bonding curves and trading incentives. The FEI token exhibits certain non-standard ERC-20 functionality, but only on a subset of transactions. There are dynamic incentives overlaid on transfers involving incentivized addresses. An incentivized address is a contract that Fei Protocol wants to incentivize certain FEI behavior. Incentivized addresses have an associated incentive contract. Incentive contracts control the direction and magnitude of incentives for each transfer. The incentive contract is appointed as a Minter and/or Burner. If a user sends FEI to an incentivized address, their remaining balance will be affected by a mint or burn incentive. The primary incentivized address in Fei Protocol is the FEI/ETH uniswap pool. Traders experience minting and burning controlled by the associated incentive contract.\n",
  "Ferrum Network": "A decentralized network like the Ethereum Network or IOTA but with a unique value proposition – instead of focusing on new coins, it can represent coins in other networks. For example, users can have Ether, Bitcoin, ERC-20 tokens, or coins from almost any other blockchain transacted in the Ferrum Network. This groundbreaking innovation allows for very interesting decentralized and interoperable applications, such as the Ferrum Decentralized Exchange (Fe DEX), and the Ferrum Wallet. Both of these decentralized applications allow users to exchange and transact nearly any digital asset in a fast and inexpensive manner, without requiring them to pass the custody of their assets to a third-party.\n",
  "Fiat": "A currency established as money, often by government regulation, but that has no intrinsic value. Fiat money does not have use value, and has value only because a government maintains its value, or because parties engaging in exchange agree on its value. It was introduced as an alternative to commodity money and representative money. Representative money is similar to fiat money, but it represents a claim on a commodity.\n",
  "Fiat-Pegged Cryptocurrency": "Also known as “pegged cryptocurrency,” it is a coin, token or asset issued on a blockchain that is linked to a government- or bank-issued currency. Each pegged cryptocurrency is guaranteed to have a specific cash value in reserves at all times.\n",

  "Filebase": "A S3-compatible object storage platform that allows users to store data in a secure, redundant, and performant manner across multiple decentralized storage networks.\n\nFilebase has taken a unique approach to object storage, today supporting the Sia, Storj, and Skynet decentralized storage networks as their underlying storage layers. Blockchain-based decentralized storage networks utilize independent storage servers operating all around the world. Filebase takes advantage of unused storage capacity and rents storage from these networks, managing all storage contracts on behalf of the user, which serve as cryptographic Service Level Agreement (SLA).\n\nPetabytes of available storage capacity is paired together with industry-leading technology and a familiar S3-Compatible API. The platform includes mechanisms for high-availability, redundancy, and privacy.\n\nWhen servers on these networks go offline, data is automatically repaired and uploaded to new hosts, without any interruption to users. When data redundancy regains perfect health, Filebase is able to achieve 3x redundancy for every object.\n\nFilebase automatically manages all aspects of the data storage layer and abstracts away all of the complexities of storing data on the Sia, Storj and Skynet networks. \n\nCustomers of Filebase do not have to purchase cryptocurrency and will never be asked to do so.\n",
  "Filecoin": "A decentralized storage network designed to store humanity's most important information. Filecoin can be used to store and retrieve data and serves as a powerful and dynamic distributed cloud storage network for user data. Filecoin can be used for app data, company files, public datasets, private data, websites, video, dapp websites, podcast data, security archives, contract data, and personal files. Filecoin combines with IPFS, a peer-to-peer distributed network protocol, to make a more efficient and secure web free from corporate control. The Filecoin network achieves staggering economies of scale by allowing anyone to participate as a storage provider and compete for your business. Content addressing and cryptographic storage proofs verify data is being stored correctly and securely over time.\n",
  "Filecoin Token": "The native protocol token of Filecoin, which miners earn by providing storage to clients. Conversely, clients spend Filecoin hiring miners to store or distribute data. As with Bitcoin, Filecoin miners compete to mine blocks with sizable rewards, but Filecoin mining power is proportional to active storage, which directly provides a useful service to clients (unlike Bitcoin mining, whose usefulness is limited to maintaining blockchain consensus). This creates a powerful incentive for miners to amass as much storage as they can, and rent it out to clients. The protocol weaves these amassed resources into a self-healing storage network that anybody in the world can rely on. The network achieves robustness by replicating and dispersing content, while automatically detecting and failures. Clients can select replication parameters to protect against different threat models. The protocol’s cloud storage network also provides security, as content is encrypted end-to-end at the client, while storage providers do not have access to decryption keys. Filecoin works as an incentive layer on top of IPFS, which can provide storage infrastructure for any data. It is especially useful for decentralizing data, building and running distributed applications, and implementing smart contracts.\n",

The FIN token also represents voting rights for holders, with one token equalling one vote on the network, empowering users to control the development of the platform. Lastly, the FIN token acts as proof of premium on the platform, with users being rewarded in FIN for lending capital and collateral on the network.\n",
  "Finality": "The assurance or guarantee that cryptocurrency transactions cannot be altered, reversed, or canceled after they are completed. The latency level of a blockchain will ultimately affect the chain's finality rate. So, finality is used to measure the amount of time one has to wait for a reasonable guarantee that crypto transactions executed on the blockchain will not be reversed or changed. In other words, they will not be lost. Finality is an essential feature for ventures accepting cryptocurrencies because waiting endlessly on a blockchain network can have a high adverse effect for businesses or enterprises that accept crypto as a means of payment. When creating a payment system, to be effective, it is crucial to have low latency.\n",

  "Fireblocks": "A digital asset custody, transfer and settlement platform. The firm provides several products that let clients store, transfer and issue digital assets. In particular, Fireblocks provides custody to institutional investors.\n\nThe company uses multi-party computation to handle private keys. When users create a wallet, cryptographic secrets are generated on their device and on the servers. Whenever users try to initiate a transaction, multiple secrets are used to generate a full public and private key. This way, there is no single point of failure.\n\nThe company has also put together a network of liquidity partners. Clients can connect directly with 30 different exchanges and initiate transfers from there. That is why over-the-counter trading desks and market makers also use Fireblocks to settle trades across several exchanges.\n\nFireblocks also lets clients issue and manage tokens. It can be particularly useful if they want to issue stablecoins, tokens that are backed by fiat currencies and do not fluctuate over time against their fiat value.

There is a DeFi API so clients can take advantage of the most interesting DeFi protocols.\n\nThe company also integrates with compliance providers Elliptic and Chainalysis for anti-money laundering reasons. The company can flag and reject transactions depending on a set of rules.\n\nFireblocks provides plenty of integrations with the crypto ecosystem at large. Starting from scratch and building those integrations in house would require a ton of resources, especially if cryptocurrencies are not the core element of their business.\n",
  "First Mover": "A service or product that gains a competitive advantage by being the first to market with a product or service. Being first typically enables a company to establish strong brand recognition and customer loyalty before competitors enter the arena. Other advantages include additional time to perfect its product or service and setting the market price for the new item.\n\nFirst movers in an industry are almost always followed by competitors that attempt to capitalize on the first mover's success and gain market share.

  "Fiscal Policy": "The means by which a government adjusts its spending levels and tax rates to monitor and influence a nation's economy. It is the sister strategy to monetary policy through which a central bank influences a nation's money supply. These two policies are used in various combinations to direct a country's economic goals.\n\nFiscal policy is based on the theories of British economist John Maynard Keynes. Also known as Keynesian economics, this theory basically states that governments can influence macroeconomic productivity levels by increasing or decreasing tax levels and public spending. This influence, in turn, curbs inflation (generally considered to be healthy when between 2% and 3%), increases employment, and maintains a healthy value of money. Fiscal policy plays a very important role in managing a country's economy. For example, in 2012 many worried that the fiscal cliff, a simultaneous increase in tax rates and cuts in government spending set to occur in January 2013, would send the U.S. economy back into recession. The U.S. Congress avoided this problem by passing the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 on Jan. 1, 2013.\n",

  "Flash Crash": "An event in electronic securities markets wherein the withdrawal of stock orders rapidly amplifies price declines. The result appears to be a rapid sell-off of securities that can happen over a few minutes, resulting in dramatic declines.\n",
  "Flash Loan": "A special type of uncollateralised loan that allows the borrowing of an asset, as long as the borrowed amount (and a fee) is returned before the end of the transaction. From the developers’ perspective, this entails building a contract that allows users to take the required actions and pay back the loan plus interest and fees in the same transaction. If the loan fails to return within the same transaction, the transaction is reversed, ensuring the safety of the pool which the loan was drawn from. Some examples of flash loan applications include the arbitration between assets, without needing to have the principal amount to execute the arbitrage as well as the swapping of collateral of loan positions, without having to repay the debt of the loan positions. \n",
  "Flashbots": "A research and development organization working on mitigating the negative externalities of current Miner-Extractable Value (MEV) extraction techniques and avoiding the existential risks MEV could cause to state-rich blockchains like Ethereum.

  "Flexa": "An instant, fraud-proof payments network for digital assets. Using a Flexa-enabled wallet app, anyone can spend a variety of cryptocurrencies, ERC20 tokens, stablecoins, and reward points—instantly, privately, and with zero fees—at multi-national brands across the US and Canada. Making a payment with Flexa takes less than a second, in stores or online. And because Flexa is fundamentally composed of decentralized infrastructure, its network is faster, safer, and more secure than traditional payment instruments like credit/debit cards and gift cards. Core to the Flexa network is the Flexacoin collateral token (FXC), which secures all Flexa payments in real-time and allows the underlying digital asset transactions to ultimately confirm and settle on chain. Using the Flexa Capacity smart contracts, anyone can provide FXC collateral to Flexa-enabled wallets that they believe are trustworthy and useful—and in return, they earn a network reward in the form of the small processing fee that Flexa charges to merchants. Flexa payments are currently available on iOS and Android, and are coming to dozens of digital wallets by the end of 2020. With support for more than two dozen different digital currencies, Flexa claims to be the simplest, easiest, and safest way to spend digital assets today.\n",
  "Flexacoin": "A neutral collateral token used to support instant payments at retail points-of-sale, and to make cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin acceptable to large, multinational retailers. The token is used to temporarily secure cryptocurrency transactions while they are awaiting confirmation on the blockchain. To put it another way, Flexacoin represents the assurance that any given Flexa network transaction will settle, which enables Flexa to advance fiat to a merchant in real time in order to complete a retail transaction. In the unlikely event that a cryptocurrency transaction is never confirmed — e.g., due to malicious activity or blockchain vulnerabilities — Flexacoin collateral can be liquidated to cover this fiat advance.\n",
  "Flexible Leverage Index": "A structured product in ERC20 format that enables traders to automate a target leveraged exposure in a completely decentralized manner. The Flexible Leverage Index (FLI) is the second collaboration between Index Coop and DeFi Pulse. The FLI uses a novel strategy built on Set Protocol and Compound that abstracts collateralized debt management into a simple index — constructed as an ERC-20 token. Initially available for ETH, FLIs can be created & launched for other assets on lending protocols, such as wBTC, YFI, and LINK.\n\nThe FLI is designed to absorb major volatility spikes, and flexibly rebalance to ensure that collateral levels stay above liquidation thresholds. The FLI also utilizes an emergency delevering mechanism to add additional safety for users in the event of a black swan event. Another benefit of FLI which decreases risk is redeemability. FLI is the first fully-collateralized leverage token which is redeemable into its components (ETH, USDC). Collateralization allows for a better risk profile than relying on synthetic leverage.\n\nFLI also dampens user fee burden by utilizing a unique algorithm that increases rebalancing efficiency by an order of magnitude. Additionally, the token's 1.95% (annualized) streaming fee is considerably less expensive than alternatives on centralized exchanges, and there is no slippage due to composable entry and exit.\n",
  "Flexible Organizations": "A financial infrastructure that does not require a bank, and trends toward trustless open systems. Term coined by Ryan Sean Adams\n",
  "Flip Challenge": "Used in the Idena blockchain. A flip is a sort of a CAPTCHA that helps to determine whether a user is human. In contrast to a CAPTCHA, which stands for \"Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart\" and is usually generated by an automated service, a flip should be created by a human. And unlike a usual CAPTCHA, which is based on object recognition, solving a flip requires a semantic interpretation of the relationship between objects. Each flip contains two stories in pictures. One of them (left or right) is a sequence of pictures that is created by a human as a meaningful story. The other is created by the same author as illogical. Stories are \"read\" from top to bottom. Solving a flip is choosing the story that seems logical. If both stories seem meaningful or meaningless, the task is still to choose the one which seems more logical than the other and thus would rather be chosen by other people. A flip is not an IQ test but a test for common sense. There are no predefined correct answers: The correct answer will be the one chosen by a majority of people.\n",

It is designed to be the first truly native internet currency and fully satisfying all three of major properties of money: as a medium of exchange, a store of value and a unit of account. Unlike most stablecoins, whilst FLOAT is designed to be stable and have significantly lower volatility than most cryptocurrencies, it is not designed to hold its price at $1.00. Instead, like most major fiat currencies, it is designed to float and change value over time. FLOAT is stabilized through frequent auctions to expand or contract the supply. It is also partly supported by a basket of cryptocurrencies that are used as part of the auction process.\n",
  "Floating Pragma": "Contracts should be deployed with the same compiler version and flags that they have been tested with thoroughly. Locking the pragma helps to ensure that contracts do not accidentally get deployed using, for example, an outdated compiler version that might introduce bugs that affect the contract system negatively. Lock the pragma version and also consider known bugs (https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases) for the compiler version that is chosen. Pragma statements can be allowed to float when a contract is intended for consumption by other developers, as in the case with contracts in a library or EthPM package. Otherwise, the developer would need to manually update the pragma in order to compile locally.\n",
  "Floflis": "A (d)app ecosystem which can serve as a standalone Operating System (OS). It is free, open(ethical)-source and decentralized. Lightweight or full-featured as to the user's choice.

The tree folder is more easy and organized than Linux (like in Windows), has its own init system that puts IPFS and CJDNS to work at the boot, and other daemons for new services and interactions that are being worked. At Floflis, security is seen with a paranoid vision. An example of that is Floflis Shield, a brand new daemon for app permissions.\n\nAll Linux OSes claims themselves as free/libre; but they puts users at risk when downloading updates (for OS and its softwares) from centralized servers. Floflis is decentralized, with updates from P2P network (Dat/IPFS protocols), storing data in a blockchain-like (append-only logs) datastore.\n\nIt is lightweight, fast, and smooth.

  "Frame": "An OS-level Ethereum interface that lets you use standalone signers, such as a Ledger or Trezor, to interact with dapps and the Ethereum network.\n",
  "Fraud Proof": "Fraud Proofs present evidence that a state transition was incorrect. They reflect an optimistic view of the world: the assumption is that blocks represent only correct states of L2 data, until proven otherwise. In reality, a committed block could well include an incorrect state transition.\n\nThe main advantage of Fraud Proofs is that they are not needed for every state transition, but only when things supposedly break down. As such, they require fewer computational resources, and are a better fit for a scalability-constrained environment. The main disadvantage of these protocols stems from their interactivity: they define a ‘conversation’ between multiple parties. A conversation requires the parties — the party claiming fraud, in particular — to be present (liveness), and allows other parties to interrupt the conversation by various means. But the heart of the problem is the protocol’s interpretation of silence (the absence of a challenge to a new state) as implicit consent. Indeed, an attacker could attempt to create the semblance of silence with DDoS attacks.\n",
  "Frax Finance": "The first fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. Frax is open-source, permissionless, and entirely on-chain – currently implemented on Ethereum (with possible cross chain implementations in the future). The end goal of the Frax protocol is to provide a highly scalable, decentralized, algorithmic money in place of fixed-supply digital assets like BTC.\n",
  "Frax Shares": "The governance token of Frax Finance which accrues fees, seigniorage revenue, and excess collateral value. The only parameters that are up for governance through FXS is adding/adjusting collateral pools, adjusting minting/redemption fees, and refresh rate of the collateral ratio. No other actions such as active management of collateral or addition of human-modifiable parameters are possible other than a hardfork that would require voluntarily moving to a new implementation entirely.\n",
  "FRAX token": "The algorithmic stablecoin of Frax Finance that targets a tight band around $1/coin. FRAX stablecoins can be minted by placing the appropriate amount of its constituent parts into the system. At genesis, FRAX is 100% collateralized, meaning that minting FRAX only requires placing collateral into the minting contract. During the fractional phase, minting FRAX requires placing the appropriate ratio of collateral and burning the ratio of Frax Shares (FXS). While the protocol is designed to accept any type of cryptocurrency as collateral, this implementation of the Frax Protocol will mainly accept on-chain stablecoins as collateral to smoothen out volatility in the collateral so that FRAX can transition to more algorithmic ratios smoothly. As the velocity of the system increases, it becomes easier and safer to include volatile cryptocurrency such as ETH and wrapped BTC into future pools with governance. \n",
  "FRENS": "A non-transferable balance within the Aavegotchi Staking Contract. FRENS cannot be purchased. They are meant to reward stakers for their contributions to the Aavegotchi project.

  "FUDster": "Someone that is spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt).\n",
  "Fuel Labs": "A permissionless and trustless layer-2 protocol for Ethereum, targeted at low-cost high-throughput value-transfer transactions. Fuel is powered by a highly-optimized optimistic rollup design. It is completely decentralized: non-custodial, censorship-resistant, and permissionless. It is the most scalable optimistic rollup in the world, with unique UTXO-based design and can handle up to 10,000 TPS surge intake capacity. Fees can be paid in any token, not just ETH.\n",
  "FujiDAO": "The first borrowing aggregator in DeFi. FujiDAO aims to optimize loan expenses for DeFi users. The protocol achieves this by constantly monitoring borrow markets and whenever there is a better rate, it automatically refinances the whole pool of debt.\n\nThe advantages of Fuji compared to interacting directly with a base protocol are:\n\ncost optimization - minimize the interest paid by borrowers\neconomics of scale - pooling funds together reduce the transactional costs by sharing fixed costs\ntime-saving - removal of constant attention users need to pay to find optimal rates\nsmooth UX - manage easily all debt positions from one place\n\nFuji DAO creates vaults where users deposit a single asset as collateral and borrow against it another asset. For example, in the ETH/DAI vault, users deposit ETH and borrow DAI. Thus, isolating debt positions allows for better risk management and the most effective interest rate optimizations.\n\nWhen users borrow from a Fuji vault, the needed liquidity gets sourced directly from the base protocol proposing the best rate (Compound, Aave, dYdX, and more to come).\n\nThe protocol keeps track of users' individual positions and assures the overall vault's health through a classical liquidation mechanism. To avoid liquidation, users need to maintain the proportion of their debt to the amount of collateral they provided above a certain threshold.\n\nWhen market conditions change and there's a provider with a lower borrow rate for a certain asset, the protocol triggers a rebalance operation and refinances the whole position of the vault. In that way, users instantaneously get a better rate on their loans without the need to take any action on their side.\n",
  "Fulcrum": "A front-end web interface for interacting with the bZx smart contracts. Fulcrum is built on the bZx base protocol and extends the protocol by allowing both loans and margin positions to be tokenized. Tokenized loans, called iTokens, are for letting the user lend their assets and earn interest. Tokenized positions, called pTokens, are for gaining long or short market exposure to an asset, and for letting the user trade with borrowed funds and with leverage. Both iTokens and pTokens are ERC20-compliant and provide access to the read-only functions symbol, name, decimals, totalSupply, balanceOf, and allowance, as well as the state-changing functions transfer, transferFrom, approve, increaseApproval, and decreaseApproval. Collectively, the team refers to both iTokens and pTokens as \"Fulcrum tokens\".\n",
  "Fulcrum Emergency Ejection": "A smart contract that automatically calculates the maximal claimable amount in Fulcrum iETH pool. It helps the user to withdraw stuck funds as much as possible. While withdrawing from Fulcrum, two requirements must be fulfilled: the user has to have that much iETH deposited and that there is enough liquidity in the iToken's contract. Product from Hakka Finance.\n",
  "Full Node": "A computer in a network that has a complete, current copy of the blockchain ledger, and verifies the correctness of transactions and new blocks. When talking about blockchain technology, we have two types of full nodes: (1) A full node that maintains an entire copy of the blockchain program and also receives, records, verifies, and transmits transactions on the blockchain. This process is known as “mining”; or (2) A full node that only receives and transmits transactions on the blockchain program. This process is passive and relies on a mining full node for updates.\n",
  "Fully Diluted Market Value": "The concept of a market cap that includes future dilution. Some common forms of dilution are tokens being released from vesting and new supply issuance. \n",
  "Fundamental Analysis": "A method of measuring a security's intrinsic value by examining related economic and financial factors. Fundamental analysts study anything that can affect the security's value, from macroeconomic factors such as the state of the economy and industry conditions to microeconomic factors like the effectiveness of the company's management. The end goal is to arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in order to see whether the security is undervalued or overvalued. This method of stock analysis is considered to be in contrast to technical analysis, which forecasts the direction of prices through an analysis of historical market data such as price and volume.\n",
  "Funding Rates": "Transfer payments made between long and short positions on perpetual swap futures markets. They are designed to keep contract prices consistent with the underlying asset. Traditional futures contracts, such as quarterly contracts, settle positions using the underlying asset price at their expiry date. This causes their price to converge to the asset's spot value over time, until they expire. Perpetual swap contracts, however, do not have an expiry date to incentivize this convergence. This means that some other mechanism is required to keep the contract price in line with the price of the underlying asset. This is where funding rates come in. \n\nFunding rates influence the price of perpetual swap contracts by penalizing or rewarding traders, depending on the nature of their position (long or short). The side of the market benefitting from the funding rate is determined by the difference between the contract price and the price of the underlying asset. When the contract price is too high – defined as being above spot price- long positions will pay short positions a fee. Conversely, when the contract price is too low – defined as being below spot price – short positions will pay long positions a fee.\n\nFunding rates are applied periodically to open positions held by traders on perpetual swap markets. The rates are applied in proportion to the size of each trader's position. The funding rate is adjusted for each period that it is applied, in accordance with any recent gaps between the price of the contracts and the spot price of the asset. Each exchange has its own method of calculating and applying their unique funding rates, which are most often derived from a time-weighted average of pricing data. The most significant difference between exchanges is how often they apply their funding rates, which can vary from as long as every 8 hours, to as rapidly as every second.\n",
  "Fungibility": "The ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type. Fungible assets simplify the exchange and trade processes, as fungibility implies equal value between the assets.\n",
  "Furucombo": "A tool built for end-users to optimize their DeFi strategy simply by drag and drop. It visualizes complex DeFi protocols into cubes. Users setup inputs/outputs and the order of the cubes, then Furucombo bundles all the cubes into one transaction and sends out. They call this building-blocks setup a \"combo\". If users do not know what to do, they can find inspirations from pre-built combos at the Explore page. Furucombo does not charge any fees.\n",
  "Fuse": "Product of Rari Capital. Fuse is a protocol that supports isolated interest rate markets. Pool creators can choose all the parameters they want: interest rate curves, oracles, etc. and then users can enter and exit positions in each of the pools. This is all done trustlessly and no longer requires lobbying to a DAO to list any given asset.\n",
  "Fuse Token": "Token that is required to be paid to the Fuse network to approve transactions. The network is using the token to create circulation between users that look to validate transactions on the network and validators who invest computing resources and maintain it. Every block created on the Fuse chain is creating new Fuse tokens rewarded to the validators. This creates a 5% yearly inflation rate of Fuse tokens in circulation. Fuse holders can lock it and delegate it to a validator in order to protect against inflation and get rewarded with Fuse tokens. The holders can select their favorite validator and validators are selected based on having the most Fuse tokens staked. The native Fuse token is represented via an ERC-20 token on Ethereum mainnet and can be moved between the Fuse chain and Ethereum using the bridge.\n",
  "Fusion": "An open source svg iconset for the cryptospace, optimized for inline embedding and customizeable via css, made with love by Richard Schumann. Further updates include adding various ways to implement these icons in dapps/websites.\n",
  "Future of France": "Slang term meaning \"Future of Finance.\"\n",
  "Future Yield Tokens": "For the APWine Protocol, Future Yield Tokens (FYT) represent the future yield generated by an asset on one platfrom for a defined period. For example, one 30D-AAVE-ADAI-2 represents the yield generated by 1 ADAI (a.k.a. one DAI deposited on AAVE) during 30 days. The 2 represents the index of the future, as a new future starts each time the period of the precedent ends.\n",
  "Futures Contract": "A legal agreement to buy or sell a particular commodity asset, or security at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. Futures contracts are standardized for quality and quantity to facilitate trading on a futures exchange. The buyer of a futures contract is taking on the obligation to buy and receive the underlying asset when the futures contract expires. The seller of the futures contract is taking on the obligation to provide and deliver the underlying asset at the expiration date. A futures contract allows an investor to speculate on the direction of a security, commodity, or a financial instrument, either long or short, using leverage. Futures are also often used to hedge the price movement of the underlying asset to help prevent losses from unfavorable price change.\n",
  "Futureswap": "A decentralized futures exchange governed by the community. Futureswap is built on Ethereum and is completely run by smart contracts. The system is transparent and simple to understand. Futureswap offers up to 20x leveraged perpetuals on all pairs.

There will be 100,000,000 FST minted over the course of 9 years.\n",
  "Gain": "An increase in the value of an asset or property. A gain arises if the selling price of the asset is higher than the original purchase price. A gain can occur anytime in the life of an asset. If an investor owns a stock purchased for $15 and the market now prices that stock at $20, then the investor is sitting on a five dollar gain. That said, a gain only truly matters when the asset is sold and the gains are realized as profit. An asset may see many unrealized gains and losses between purchase and sale because the market is constantly reassessing the value of assets.\n",
  "Gala Games": "A blockchain games startup that aims to revolutionize the games industry. Their goal is for players to own their content (in-game items are owned by the players, not by the firm) and to own the roadmap (gamers to have a say as to what kind of games the firm will develop).\n",
  "GALA Token": "The native digital cryptographically-secured utility mark of the Gala Games ecosystem (GALA) is a transferable representation of attributed functions specified in the protocol/code of the Gala Games ecosystem, which is designed to play a major role in the functioning of the ecosystem on the Gala Games ecosystem and intended to be used solely as the primary utility token within the ecosystem.

GALA is currently based on the Ethereum blockchain and conforms to the ERC-20 standard. GALA is a non-refundable functional utility token which will be used as the medium of exchange between participants on the Gala Games ecosystem. The goal of introducing GALA is to provide a convenient and secure mode of payment and settlement between participants who interact within the ecosystem on the Gala Games ecosystem (for example, payment of digital goods or in-game items), and it is not, and not intended to be, a medium of exchange accepted by the public (or a section of the public) as payment for goods or services or for the discharge of a debt; nor is it designed or intended to be used by any person as payment for any goods or services whatsoever that are not exclusively provided by the issuer.\n",
  "Gallery Finance": "The first non-fungible token (NFT) workshop that combines innovative DeFi mechanisms to create community-voted artworks. It is an open platform where community ideas are turned into art, and all artists are rewarded.\n\nIn addition to custom art workshops, Gallery Finance enables users to generate and auction off their own NFTs, as well as display their art via a decentralized exhibition hall.\n\nThe team ensures that intellectual property of artists is always protected: that's why they allocate 30% of transaction fees from all the auctions to the original creators of NFTs.\n",
  "Gallery Finance Community Token": "The utility token of the Gallery Finance ecosystem. Its main purpose is to incentivize the community to participate in NFT creation and distribution. There are 4 uses of GLF: (1) Customized art workshops, (2) NFT generation, (3) NFT Auctions, and (4) Exhibition hall.\n\nCustomized art workshops: Unlike existing NFT marketplaces that only let you purchase existing artworks, Gallery Finance allows users to vote for custom art that they want to see created. Participants can stake tokens to create customized workshops with any theme they would like artists to work on. To propose a themed contest, users need to stake 100 $GLF tokens for 4 consecutive days.\n\nNFT generation: Users can generate their own NFTs through Gallery Finance.

  "GameSwap": "A P2P in-game asset exchange leveraging Ethereum standards for fungible and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). It’s 100% community-driven, without central points of control or authority. It will work similar to Uniswap, with AMM providing liquidity via pools, but with a strong focus on in-game assets. However, unlike Uniswap, the base currency will be GSWAP instead of ETH. The ultimate goal is bridging gaming and crypto asset trading with a neutral layer belonging to the users, making gamers feel at home and in control. All spiced with superior UX and economic incentives for both gamers and game devs. The following types of trade will be supported: (a) ERC20 to ERC20 (these being in-game tokens); (b) ERC20 to NFT, and vice versa; (c) NFT to NFT: where the user can exchange one or several items for another .item (or group of items). Price differences will be settled in GSWAP; and (d) Cash Out: any in-game item, or group of items to stablecoin.\n",
  "Gamma (Options)": "If you look at Delta as the \"speed\" of your option position, Gamma is the \"acceleration\". It is the second derivative of the value of the option with respect to the underlying instrument’s price. Gamma when buying options, calls or puts, is always positive; when writing options - always negative. Gamma is highest for the ATM strike, and slopes off toward the ITM and OTM strikes. One good way of interpreting Gamma is that a buyer’s side Gamma \"manufactures\" Deltas in the direction the underlying asset is moving. That is, positive Gamma is why buying a call gets more positive Delta when the underlying asset price rises, and why buying a put gets more negative Deltas when the underlying asset price falls.\n\nA writer's side Gamma can be dangerous. When your speculation on an underlying asset's price is wrong, a writer's side Gamma makes it worse. But if you think the price of an underlying asset is going to move a great deal very quickly, you want to buy an option with relatively high Gamma. The high positive Gamma will get you more Deltas if the underlying asset price moves the way you want it to, and reduce your Deltas if the underlying asset price moves against you.\n",
  "Gamma (Protocol)": "A decentralized capital efficient option protocol that enables sellers to create spreads. Gamma protocol enables any user to create arbitrary European style option tokens, that represent the right to buy or sell a certain asset in a predefined price (strike price) at or before expiry. As the option seller in Gamma, you can reduce the amount of capital locked in the system by creating spreads. (e.g Instead of putting down 100 USDC and mint 1 ETH-USDC-100 Put, you can buy a ETH-USDC-50 Put, and only deposit 50 USDC as collateral) The oTokens created by Gamma are cash settled European option, means all the options will automatically be exercised at expiry. A holder can redeem the proceeds by sending the oTokens back, the system will pay the holder the cash value based on strike price and underlying spot price at expiry, instead of actually exchanging the underlying asset and the strike asset.\n",

  "GEL Token": "Native token of Gelato Network. The token adds two key functionalities to the Gelato ecosystem.\n\nGovernance: All token holders will be able to have a say in the future direction of the protocol via voting on proposals in the Gelato DAO. The goal is that in the long run, developers that use Gelato to automate their smart contracts functions will govern over the protocol in order to determine the \"rules\" by which the Executor bots that serve the network have to adhere by. Decisions include setting fees for Executors, deciding on developer incentive schemes, and enforcing that Executors always execute transactions in the best interest of the end-user.\n\nStaking & Slashing: For Executor bots, in order to be able to participate in executing transactions in the Gelato Network and thus earning rewards from doing so, they will need to acquire & stake $GEL. Staking will allow executors to earn the ability to reserve \"slots\" which give them the exclusive right to earn fees from executing transactions in a certain period of time. Potentially slashing the stake of Executors bots will serve the purpose of disincentivizing bad behavior, such as censoring or front running transactions, making such actions uneconomical. The Gelato DAO will have the power to enforce these decisions and the obligation to monitor the behavior of Executors. Executors will become more accountable for their actions which will enable them to further decentralize who can run these Nodes as well as providing some interesting future functionalities such as executing transactions based on off-chain conditions.\n",
  "Gelato Network": "A tool for developers to automate smart contract executions on Ethereum.

  "Gold Standard": "A monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. With the gold standard, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold. A country that uses the gold standard sets a fixed price for gold and buys and sells gold at that price. That fixed price is used to determine the value of the currency. For example, if the U.S. sets the price of gold at $500 an ounce, the value of the dollar would be 1/500th of an ounce of gold.\n\nThe gold standard is not currently used by any government. Britain stopped using the gold standard in 1931 and the U.S. followed suit in 1933 and abandoned the remnants of the system in 1973.\n\nThe gold standard was completely replaced by fiat money, a term to describe currency that is used because of a government's order, or fiat, that the currency must be accepted as a means of payment. In the U.S., for instance, the dollar is fiat money, and for Nigeria, it is the naira.\n\nThe appeal of a gold standard is that it arrests control of the issuance of money out of the hands of imperfect human beings. With the physical quantity of gold acting as a limit to that issuance, a society can follow a simple rule to avoid the evils of inflation. The goal of monetary policy is not just to prevent inflation, but also deflation, and to help promote a stable monetary environment in which full employment can be achieved. A brief history of the U.S. gold standard is enough to show that when such a simple rule is adopted, inflation can be avoided, but strict adherence to that rule can create economic instability, if not political unrest.\n",

It applies to any type of group, be it in the real world or digital. Therefore, for any kind of institutions, organizations, or services, especially as it grows, governance becomes increasingly indispensable. The governance style also needs to keep evolving to be relevant to the current need. Initially, the blockchain used to be a governance-free system, given the small user base. With increasing userbase and lots of moving parts and features, blockchain governance has to always adapt and adjust to user needs in order to stay relevant.\n",

In other cases, the team maintaining the project is tasked with applying the changes or hiring someone who will. Proponents of systems that use governance tokens believe that they allow for user control, which holds true to the original cryptocurrency ideals of decentralization and democratization. In most cases, organizations who let users control the development of their systems are called decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).\n",

Names on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. Handshake aims to experiment with new ways the internet can be more secure, resilient, and socially useful with a peer-to-peer system validated by the network's participants. Handshake is an experiment which seeks to explore those new ways in which the necessary tools to build a more decentralized internet. Services on the internet have become more centralized beginning in the 1990s, but do not fulfill the original decentralized vision of the internet. Email became Gmail, usenet became reddit, blog replies became facebook and Medium, pingbacks became twitter, squid became Cloudflare, even gnutella became The Pirate Bay. Centralization exists because there is a need to manage spam, griefing, and sockpuppet/sybil attacks. Previous decentralized systems largely stopped working due to spam. If it were more costly to grief on the internet using decentralized systems, the need for trusted centralized corporations to manage these risks decrease. Internet services and platforms may benefit from building on top of a decentralized system which is specifically designed for resilience against sybil attacks. As we may redecentralize.\n",

  "Hash": "Any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes. The values are used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing. Hash functions and their associated hash tables are used in data storage and retrieval applications to access data in a small and nearly constant time per retrieval, and storage space only fractionally greater than the total space required for the data or records themselves. Hashing is a computationally and storage space efficient form of data access which avoids the non-linear access time of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees, and the often exponential storage requirements of direct access of state spaces of large or variable-length keys. Use of hash functions relies on statistical properties of key and function interaction: worst case behavior is intolerably bad with a vanishingly small probability, and average case behavior can be nearly optimal (minimal collisions). Hash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions, error-correcting codes, and ciphers. Although the concepts overlap to some extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed and optimized differently. The hash functions differ from the concepts numbered mainly in terms of data integrity.\n",
  "Hash Collisions With Multiple Variable Length Arguments": "Using abi.encodePacked() with multiple variable length arguments can, in certain situations, lead to a hash collision. Since abi.encodePacked() packs all elements in order regardless of whether they're part of an array, you can move elements between arrays and, so long as all elements are in the same order, it will return the same encoding. In a signature verification situation, an attacker could exploit this by modifying the position of elements in a previous function call to effectively bypass authorization. When using abi.encodePacked(), it's crucial to ensure that a matching signature cannot be achieved using different parameters. To do so, either do not allow users access to parameters used in abi.encodePacked(), or use fixed length arrays. Alternatively, you can simply use abi.encode() instead. It is also recommended that you use replay protection, although an attacker can still bypass this by front-running.\n",
  "Hashed TimeLock Contract": "A special feature that is used to create smart contracts that are able to modify payment channels. Technically, the HTLC feature enables the implementation of time-bound transactions between two users. In practice, the recipient of a HTLC transaction has to acknowledge the payment by submitting a cryptographic proof within a specified timeframe (number of blocks). If the recipient forfeits or fails to claim the payment, the funds will be returned to the original sender.\n\nThe HTLC feature is applied in both bidirectional and routed payment channels to allow the secure transfers of funds over various channels, without requiring trust on any of the intermediaries.\n",

  "Herd Privacy": "A term referring to when a Decentralized Identifier (DID) subject is indistinguishable from others in the herd, privacy is available. When the act of engaging privately with another party is by itself a recognizable flag, privacy is greatly diminished. DIDs and DID methods need to work to improve herd privacy, particularly for those who legitimately need it most. Choose technologies and human interfaces that default to preserving anonymity and pseudonymity. To reduce digital fingerprints, share common settings across requesting party implementations, keep negotiated options to a minimum on wire protocols, use encrypted transport layers, and pad messages to standard lengths.\n",
  "Hermez": "A zk-rollup which allows for scaling payments and token transfers on top of the Ethereum public blockchain. It is designed with high-frequency tokens like ETH, DAI, Tether, and wBTC in mind.\n\nHermez uses the Ethereum public blockchain for data storage instead of computation, i.e. it handles data availability on-chain but does computation offchain. In addition, by utilising zeroknowledge proofs, it attaches an easily verifiable on-chain proof that the off-chain computations have been carried out correctly.\n\nSince both the data and zero-knowledge proof are available onchain, Hermez relies on the same security assumptions as Ethereum. This means Hermez is as censorship-resistant as Ethereum.\n\nOne of the most important things about Hermez, is the way in which it decides who the next rollup batch creator should be. Hermez integrates an auction where everyone intending to become a coordinator – the batch creator in the Hermez ecosystem - bids the number of tokens they are willing to donate in order to obtain the right to create the next batch.\n\nThe winning bid is the highest amount of tokens. And this address is assigned the right to create the next batch.\n\nIn the Hermez Network this mechanism is referred as proof-of-donation because a significant fraction of this bid is donated to the protocols and social services that run on top of Ethereum.\n",
  "Hetoro": "A secondary market & analysis of on-chain data for Hegic.\n",
  "Hex": "A Certificate of Deposit on the blockchain. Certificates of Deposit (CD's) are common investment tools managed by banks. CD's are used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide, creating a market valued in the trillions of dollars. HEX has taken the concept of CD's, added significantly higher average interest rates, removed banking fees, and turned it into a decentralized cryptocurrency. By locking any amount of Hex the user choose for a period of time between 1 and 5,555 days, they \"stake\" their deposit and gain interest every single day. Average APY is over 40%. Average APY for a bank CD is less than 2%. No central entity, bureaucracy, or overhead, and no bonuses awarded to anyone besides users who stake HEX. As a simple to use, high interest investment tool, HEX makes users the bank.\n",
  "Hexadecimal": "A numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols. There are no numerical symbols that represent values greater than nine, so letters taken from the English alphabet are used, specifically A, B, C, D, E and F. Hexadecimal A = decimal 10, and hexadecimal F = decimal 15.\n",
  "HEZ Token": "Native token of Hermez. The HEZ utility token is used to bid for slots to become a coordinator and portions are donated, burnt, and used to incentivise active network usage and engagement. This is the only economic design built into the core protocol from the start.\n\nBecause the tokens are not sold, but freely allocated to the initial team and community members with the vesting conditions, the Governance might decide to setup liquidity pools in permissionless DEXes and, potentially, a few centralized Exchanges as well, so to allow for the broader community to also participate and become coordinators, further enhancing and growing organically the decentralization aspect of the whole project.\n\nThe Governance and the initial development team will at the same time focus on ensuring that the launch of the Hermez network is technically sound. Once the Governance is satisfied that the network is operating as expected, it might sponsor a ‘Hermez Token Economy Hackathon” or a similar open call, inviting the community at large to collaborate with the leading token engineering experts in the space to potentially propose different economic designs for the Hermez ecosystem that can also account for broad compliance considerations.\n\nThe best designs will then be reviewed, modeled, and eventually implemented to ensure the long-term success of the Hermez Network. This allotment of tokens will be initially controlled by the Governance and some of the initial supply will be kept as reserves to be released, as needed and with a majority decision, to a legal entity additionally set up to represent the Hermez project if there are critical issues that can only be addressed in\nthis way.\n",
  "Hidden Cap": "An unknown limit to the amount of money a team elects to receive from investors in its initial coin offering (ICO). The purpose of a hidden cap is to even the playing field by letting smaller investors put in money, without the large investors forming an accurate understanding of the total cap and adjusting their investment as a result.\n",
  "Hiding Game": "The cooperation between users and keepers (arbitrage bots) to hide MEV (on-chain profit) by wrapping trades/debt in specialized on-chain contracts. It maximises the profits available from these opportunities by having priority access. The profits are then shared directly with the user as a reward for using KeeperDAO.\n",
  "HidingBook": "A backend infrastructure component of the Hiding Game which hosts hidden orders only fillable by KeeperDAO keepers. It also supports client friendly APIs which enable a smooth front end user experience.\n\nIntegrating a client with the HidingBook enables the client's users to coordinate with KeeperDAO keepers for the capture of MEV (miner extractable value). This is a win-win because both users and keepers are working together to maximize profit generation from a trade the user was going to perform anyways. The profits generated are returned back to the user in $ROOK tokens. The underlying profit token is deposited into a pool controlled by $ROOK holders.\n",
  "Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet": "A standard cryptocurrency wallet is used to store the cryptocurrency tokens or coins. It has a public address which the user can give to others to receive funds from them, and a private key that the user uses to spend the stored tokens. This public/private combination mechanism ensures safety of the cryptocurrency tokens but comes with an additional overhead of the user being required to repeatedly generate a random pair of private/public addresses (or keys), and back up each time one configures a new pair of addresses. As the number of transactions increases, this process becomes cumbersome for the user. HD Wallets, or Hierarchical Deterministic wallets, solve this problem by deriving all the addresses from a single master seed (hence the name hierarchical). All HD wallets use a variant of the standard 12-word master seed key, and each time this seed is extended at the end by a counter value which makes it possible to automatically derive an unlimited number of new addresses. HD wallets eliminate the need for the user to constantly generate and wait for the secure keys to be generated, so they only need to worry about taking the backup.\n",
  "High time preference": "Individuals with this preference place more emphasis than average on their current well-being relative to their future well-being.\n",
  "HIGH Token": "Native token of FlowerSwap.\n\nFlowerswap foundation believes that the protocol must behave in a decentralized and autonomous manner to create a fair DeFi ecosystem.

HIGH holders would propose and vote on what pair of assets are added to the protocol.\n\n100 HIGH to propose and 1 HIGH to vote. If a HIGH holder decides to add a new pair, then the HIGH holder can propose for 100 HIGH and have the community vote. If 77% of HIGH holders reach a 51% consensus, then the proposal succeeds and protocol directly updates the policy. 1 HIGH = 1 vote.\n\nHIGH acts as a voting vehicle within the ecosystem, community engagement and incentive token.\n",
  "High-Frequency Trading": "A method of trading that uses powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. It uses complex algorithms to analyze multiple markets and execute orders based on market conditions.

Some of the best-known high-frequency trading firms include Tower Research, Citadel LLC and Virtu Financial.\n",
  "Hindsight Bias": "A psychological phenomenon that allows people to convince themselves after an event that they had accurately predicted it before it happened. This can lead people to conclude that they can accurately predict other events. This occurs when investors feel pressure to time their purchases of stocks perfectly in order to maximize their returns. When they suffer a loss, they regret not acting earlier. With regret comes the thought that they saw it coming all along. In fact, it was one of the many possibilities that they might have anticipated. Whichever one of them pans out, the investor becomes convinced that he or she saw it coming.\n",
  "HODL": "A term derived from a misspelling of \"hold\" that refers to buy-and-hold strategies in the context of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n",
  "HODL Waves": "Visualization that presents a macro view of the age distribution of the coin supply and provides insight into changes to this age distribution arising from holding and spending behaviour. The metric bundles the coin supply into categories depending on age, and presents it in colour bands with a thickness proportional to the total coin supply. Changes in coin maturity as a result of spending or accumulation behaviour will be reflected in changes in HODL Wave band thicknesses over time.\n\nHODL Waves can generally be considered within the following framework:\n Thickness of HODL wave bands represents the proportion of the total coin supply that is categorised into that age band.\n Accumulation and HODLing behaviour will result in coin maturation (young to old) as an increased proportion of coins move from younger age bands (warm colours) into older age bands (cool colours). This indicates an increased long-term conviction to accumulate and hold the asset and an associated decrease in liquid circulating supply.\n Spending old coins back into the economy (old to young) will result in the proportion of warmer colour bands increasing. This may suggest a reduced long-term conviction to hold the asset and an increase in liquid circulating supply as old coins are re-activated after a period of dormancy.\n Spending young coins will reclassify them as young coins with immediate effect on the younger age band volume.\n Maturation of young coins into old coins will always be delayed by the time for coins to reach the lower bound of the older age bracket before they are reclassified into new HODL wave bands.\n\nCoined by Dhruv Bansal, Unchained Capital (April 2018).\n",
  "Hola DeFi": "A DeFi product directory for the Spanish-speaking community.\n",
  "Holographic Consensus": "The concept of identifying a group's consensus view without requiring a high participation rate in the consensus. In other words, holographic consensus refers to techniques for making decisions that represent an entire group accurately without requiring as many individuals from that group to participate as might typically be required. Holographic consensus is important for governance because it addresses what we call the scale problem: the tradeoff between scalability and representativity of decision-making. That is to say that the faster a governance system makes decisions, the more difficult it is for those decisions to accurately represent the system's constituents.\n",
  "HOLY Token": "Token that will be used to cover all banking and trading fees in the Holyheld app.\n",

  "Hop Protocol": "A protocol for sending tokens across rollups and their shared layer-1 network in a quick and trustless manner. Rollups have the potential to scale the Ethereum network, but each rollup creates a siloed environment for its applications. Moving assets between rollups and the layer-1 network is slow and expensive, diminishing the savings users gain by using the rollup. The Hop protocol allows assets to be moved directly from rollup to rollup, providing cost savings and enabling cross-rollup composability of applications.\n",

  "Howey Test": "The standard methodology, put in place by the U.S. Supreme Court, to determine whether a transaction is an example of an “investment contract.” The Howey Test refers to a 1946 case which reached the Supreme Court, SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., a lawsuit involving the Howey Company of Florida. This company was a citrus farm which operated on a large swath of land in the southern portion of the state. When the company decided to lease out half of its large property in order to \"finance an additional development,\" the question of whether or not the land itself could be seen as a security came into play. Purchasers of the Howey land, who themselves had none of the \"knowledge, skill, and equipment necessary for the care and cultivation of citrus trees,\" were speculators. They purchased the land based on the assumption that it would generate a profit for them as a result of the efforts of someone else. Howey Co. ran afoul of the law when it failed to register the transactions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) responded with an injunction to block the sale of the land, and the case was eventually appealed, finally arriving in the U.S Supreme Court. The opinion of the Court in the Howey case indicated that \"the transactions in this case clearly involve investment contracts, as so defined. The respondent companies are offering something more than fee simple interests in land...they are offering an opportunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of a large citrus fruit enterprise.\" In the case of Howey Co., the investors in the Florida land saw the transaction as valuable only because of the work that others would perform on the land. By the standards of the Howey Test, this classifies the transaction as an investment contract. Thus, the transaction needed to be registered, and the Howey Co. was found to have violated the law by failing to do that.\n",

  "Idle Finance": "A decentralized protocol dedicated to bringing automatic asset allocation and aggregation to the interest-bearing tokens economy. This protocol bundles stable crypto-assets (stablecoins) into tokenized baskets that are programmed to automatically rebalance based on different management logics. The Idle Protocol employs a strategy-token system. Every allocation strategy has its own set of tokens that represent a pool of yield-generating assets spread across different DeFi protocols. These tokens represent the investor's proportional ownership of the whole pool and the interest accrued over time. This issuing method is similar to traditional mutual funds shares structure, and it allows Idle to be non-custodial. Currently, Idle uses two different allocation strategies: (1) Best-Yield: this strategy combines multiple money markets to automatically provide the highest interest rates, beating the best traditional offerings across interest-bearing tokens and DeFi protocols; and (2) Risk-Adjusted: this strategy automatically changes the asset allocation in order to find the optimal mix between risk scores and yield. Consequently, users can hold IdleTokens related to a specific strategy and a specific stablecoin.

Their goal on the DeFi side will be to drive liquidity into the protocol via continuous integrations with quality high-level protocols so that their liquidity providers feel safe, secure and protected from notorious DeFi bogeymen like liquidation and impermanent loss. The monolithic Royale liquidity pool will serve as a staging area for stablecoins that are waiting to be deployed into iGaming opportunities. In order to maximize the potential of these stablecoins, Royale strategies will be used to ensure optimum capital efficiency.\n",
  "Illuvials": "In Illuvium (the game), they are deity-like creatures that roam a broken planet. Over time they grow and evolve, taking on new, more powerful forms. Each Illuvial has an affinity for certain elements in the world around them, making them more powerful in some situations than others. As such players are rewarded when they add Illuvials that leverage the strengths of their existing team.\n\nSome Illuvials are more common than others, with the rarest almost never being seen, let alone captured. The power of Illuvials also varies, and is loosely related to their rarity. If they are defeated in battle, they can be collected in Shards and stored on the blockchain. Players can also purchase Illuvials from other players at the Exchange. Keep an eye out for rare Shiny, Gold, or Holographic captures. These are far less common and far more valuable.\n",

Anyone can build tools or services around these assets and market them in an open, real-world economy. Freedom to trade. Freedom to build. That’s how we make virtual worlds real.\n",
  "Impermanent Gain": "Impermanent Gain can be regarded as the antimatter of impermanent loss. Impermanent Gain consists of two ERC20 tokens: Long token and Short token, which are empowered to long or short the IL. By holding the Long token, it will be able to offset the IL of holding a certain size of LP position. Therefore, liquidity providers can hedge against the risk of impermanent loss through Impermanent Gain.\n\nGenerally, it would require holding Long tokens with the amount of 10% of your position size to hedge against the potential impermanent loss of your LP position.\n\nFor example, a liquidity position of 1000 DAI requires 100 Long to hedge against impermanent loss. The cost of acquiring 100 Long tokens can be regarded as a premium.\n\nImpermanent Gain can help liquidity providers perfectly hedge against a 0 ~ -10% impermanent loss. Only when IL exceeds -10% would cause liquidity provider with Long tokens to suffer additional loss.\n",
  "Impermanent Loss": "The difference between holding tokens in an automated market maker (AMM) and holding them in your wallet. It occurs when the price of tokens inside an AMM diverge in any direction. The more divergence, the greater the impermanent loss. The loss is “impermanent” because as long as the relative prices of tokens in the AMM return to their original state when you entered the AMM, the loss disappears and you earn 100% of the trading fees. However, this is rarely the case. More often than not, impermanent loss becomes permanent, eating into your trade income or leaving you with negative returns.\nAlso commonly referred to as Divergence loss.\n\n",
  "Impossible Finance": "Impossible Finance uses decentralised financial protocols to give everyone the same access to financial products, which were previously only available to institutions and select individuals.

  "imToken": "A digital asset wallet enabling multi-chain asset management, dApp browsing and exchange of value. The wallet includes a built-in token exchange.\n",
  "In The Money": "An In The Money (ITM) option acts the most like a cryptocurrency position. Depending on how deeply it is ITM, it will act more and more like cryptocurrency. It will be affected less by time and changes in volatility, and more by the cryptocurrency price moving up and down. An ITM call may require a smaller rise in the cryptocurrency price to be profitable, but its percentage gains won't be as great as those of an ATM or OTM call. An example of an ITM CALL option would be where you buy a WBTC $50,000 strike price CALL option, and the current market price for WBTC is $60,000. An example of an OTM PUT option would be where you buy a WBTC $50,000 strike price PUT option, and the current market price for WBTC is $30,000.\n",
  "Incorrect Constructor Name": "Constructors are special functions that are called only once during the contract creation. They often perform critical, privileged actions such as setting the owner of the contract. Before Solidity version 0.4.22, the only way of defining a constructor was to create a function with the same name as the contract class containing it. A function meant to become a constructor becomes a normal, callable function if its name doesn't exactly match the contract name. This behavior sometimes leads to security issues, in particular when smart contract code is re-used with a different name but the name of the constructor function is not changed accordingly. This issue is fixed in solidity v0.4.22. Solidity version 0.4.22 introduces a new constructor keyword that make a constructor definitions clearer. It is therefore recommended to upgrade the contract to a recent version of the Solidity compiler and change to the new constructor declaration.\n",
  "Incorrect Inheritance Order": "Solidity supports multiple inheritance, meaning that one contract can inherit several contracts. Multiple inheritance introduces ambiguity called Diamond Problem: if two or more base contracts define the same function, which one should be called in the child contract? Solidity deals with this ambiguity by using reverse C3 Linearization, which sets a priority between base contracts. That way, base contracts have different priorities, so the order of inheritance matters. Neglecting inheritance order can lead to unexpected behavior. When inheriting multiple contracts, especially if they have identical functions, a developer should carefully specify inheritance in the correct order. The rule of thumb is to inherit contracts from more /general/ to more /specific/.\n",
  "Incorrect interface": "A contract interface defines functions with a different type signature than the implementation, causing two different method id's to be created. As a result, when the interfact is called, the fallback method will be executed.\n",
  "independent Dollar": "Created by Lien Finance, independent Dollar (iDOL) is a stable coin backed by ETH derivatives. iDOL is an ERC20 token that is programmed to be stable against the US dollar. iDOL is purely backed by ETH derivatives and does not use centralized assets as collateral Stabilization of the iDOL price is achieved through market mechanisms acting on arbitrage opportunities. The Lien Protocol is governance-free and therefore iDOL tokens are censorship resistant.\n\nETH derivatives are used as collateral for the iDOL stable coin and not ETH itself. During the minting process of iDOL, the Lien Protocol bifurcates, or tranches ETH into two components, the variable component and the stable component. The variable component is called the LBT, or the Liquid Bond Token. The stable component is called the SBT, or the Solid Bond Token. iDOL uses the SBT as collateral. Due to the stable nature of the SBT, iDOL is minted without over-collateralization.\n",

Indexed Finance is managed by the holders of its governance token NDX, which is used to vote on proposals for protocol updates and high level index management such as the definition of market sectors and the creation of new management strategies.\n\nThe first product developed by Indexed Finance is a set of capitalization-weighted index pools designed to replicate the behavior of index funds, which historically have returned better and more consistent returns than actively managed funds on the stock market. Index pools simplify asset management on Ethereum the way that index funds do for the stock market: by creating a single asset which represents ownership in a diverse portfolio that tracks the market sector the index represents. Each index pool has an ERC20 index token which anyone can mint by providing the underlying assets in the pool, burn to claim the underlying assets, or swap with exchanges to easily manage their exposure to specific markets.\n",

  "Infinite Approval": "A smart contract programming practice, often considered to be problematic. This programming feature sees a given smart contract require authorization to access an unlimited number of tokens from the user's wallet instead of only the number that is actually needed. An infamous example of a smart contract that was programmed this way is one employed by decentralized exchange Bancor. When a user first used the system, he had to give the smart contract an authorization to withdraw an unlimited number of tokens from his wallet. Bancor's smart contracts also contained a vulnerability that could have allowed a hacker to steal all the units of the token that the user authorized the contract to manage by leveraging this vulnerability. Fortunately, Bancor's programmers noticed before malicious actors could steal the tokens and later modified their systems to only ask for approval for the needed number of tokens. The developers preemptively \"stole\" user funds to return them later to avoid a hack. After the controversy surrounding Bancor, it surfaced that infinite approval is a very popular practice among decentralized application programmers. Research conducted by a researcher at crypto wallet ZenGo revealed that popular decentralized applications Compound, Uniswap, bZX, Aave, Kyber and dYdX all feature infinite or extremely large approvals.\n",

  "Initial Bounty Offering": "The limited-time process by which a new cryptocurrency is made public and distributed to people who invest time and skill into earning rewards in the new cryptocurrency, such as doing translation or marketing. Unlike an initial coin offering where you can buy coins, an IBO requires more mental commitment from the receiver.\n",
  "Initial Coin Offering": "An innovative approach for raising funds through the use of digital currencies (cryptocurrencies). Such a strategy is more prevalent in cryptocurrency projects that are yet to fully developed their blockchain-based product, service, or platform. The funds collected on ICO events are normally received as Bitcoin (BTC) or Ether (ETH), but in some cases, fiat currency may also be taken as payment.\n\nUsually, investors engage in Initial Coin Offerings with the hope and expectation that the digital token (or coin) and its corresponding company will be successful - possibly resulting in a good return on investment (ROI) for those that are regarded as early supporters.\n\nDespite being often compared to IPOs (Initial Public Offering), ICOs are quite different in the sense that investors are not buying any kind of ownership of shared in a company. Initial Coin Offering events are mainly performed as a fundraising strategy for startups that are in very early stages of development and need funds to push the project forward. \n\nUnfortunately, however, many ICOs are performed by non-reputable entities that raise large amounts of money and disappear, with no follow up on development. For this reason, it is extremely important that investors do their due diligence (also known as DYOR) before investing in cryptocurrency companies.\n",
  "Initial DEX Offering": "Term that refers to the launching of a cryptocurrency on a decentralized exchange (DEX). In an Initial DEX Offering (IDO), a blockchain project makes a coin's first public debut on a DEX in order to raise funding from retail investors. IDOs can be created for anything from cryptocurrency to a music album, to aether powered battle ships. IDOs offer businesses a tool for engaging their communities in an economy that both enriches their products and services while allowing them to make smart business decisions regarding their assets. IDOs have some benefits that may make them more attractive than Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Initial Exchange Offerings (IEOs): immediate liquidity, immediate trading and lower costs for listing.\n",
  "Initial Exchange Offering": "A fundraising event that is administered by an exchange. In contrast to an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) where the project team themselves conduct the fundraising, an Initial Exchange Offering means that the fundraising will be conducted on a well-known exchange’s fundraising platform, such as Binance Launchpad, where users can purchase tokens with funds directly from their own exchange wallet.\n\nFor a user, an IEO is easy to participate in as they don’t need to manage on-chain transactions with different wallets on different blockchains. Instead, a user only needs an account on the exchange and some funds in their account and can participate completely through the trusted website’s interface. Additionally, the exchange is staking its reputation behind the projects on its platform, offering a higher degree of trust behind the project.\n\nFor a project looking to raise funds, an IEO offers the promise of an immediate userbase that can see their product, and depending on the size of the exchange’s audience, could mean that the project can reduce their outside marketing funnels for fundraising, allowing them to focus only on the development of their product. \n",
  "Initial Liquidity Offerings": "For a new token to be successful it needs to be liquid (i.e., it needs buyers and sellers when it is released in an exchange). In a normal centralized exchange, while there are buyers and sellers, you may need to wait a long time to sell a newly released token. This is where Decentralized Exchanges with Automatic Market Maker (AMM) facilities come into the picture. In a decentralized exchange with an AMM, there is always a ready market for your token in the form of a computer program which is ready to pay a price for your token. To pay this price, the AMM has to be backed by a pool (store) of wealth called liquidity pool. This liquidity pool is normally in the form of stable coins. This is where an Initial Liquidity Offering (ILO) comes into the picture. In an ILO, a new token is offered to buyers who agree to contribute to the liquidity pool which will ensure that the token is attractive to new buyers and the AMM can function. In the ILO process, liquidity contributors receive the new token in exchange for the liquidity which they contribute to the pool for the AMM to work for the new token. Since they take a risk to buy the new token, bonuses are offered which are called yields. The liquidity contribution is normally made in the form of stable coins which have highly stable values. The liquidity pool for the token can become skewed if token holders sell a lot of the new token through the AMM to receive the stable coin held in the pool. For, the release of a new token, an ILO is a very attractive option since it ensures that the token can be released into an ecosystem where there is a ready market for it.\n",
  "Injective": "A Layer 2 DEX that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. It uses a fully-decentralized sidechain relayer network which serves as a layer 2 derivatives platform, trade execution coordinator (TEC), and decentralized orderbook. The core consensus is Tendermint-based. The Injective Chain provides a two-way Ethereum peg-zone for Ether and ERC-20 tokens to be transferred to the Injective Chain as well as an EVM-compatible execution environment for DeFi applications. The peg-zone is based off Peggy and the EVM execution is based off Ethermint. Injective's Orderbook is a fully decentralized 0x-based orderbook enabling sidechain order relay with on-chain settlement - a decentralized implementation of the traditionally centralized off-chain order relay used by nearly all central limit order book decentralized exchanges. Market creation is entirely open and permissionless. This enables anyone to create a market using only a price feed and deploy it to the larger Injective ecosystem.\n",

  "Ink Protocol": "A protocol for decentralized payments & reputation on Ethereum. Ink Protocol can be integrated into new or existing platforms and can also be used in marketplaces that don't directly handle payments. Ink Protocol doesn't require a marketplace. It can be used for any peer-to-peer transaction, regardless of where it happens. Ink Protocol helps users safely send and receive payments in P2P transactions and marketplaces while earning public reputation for every completed transaction. Sellers can take their earned reputation with them from marketplace to marketplace. To ensure sellers' reputations are credible, feedback may only be given on completed transactions. Ink Protocol's built-in dispute resolution allows a mediator to be assigned to a transaction. Mediators exist as independent Smart Contracts and are jointly agreed upon by the buyer and seller. With mediation, payment is held in escrow until the buyer confirms the transaction. In the event of a dispute, the mediator works with both parties to decide on an outcome. Marketplaces, payment apps, and mediation services can all use Ink Protocol. Listia will integrate the Ink Protocol into its existing marketplace and immediately begin development of the Ink Pay app. Developers can build their own marketplaces, payment apps, and other services to leverage the Ink Protocol platform.\n",
  "Ink Protocol Token": "The underlying currency used in all Ink Protocol transactions. As a result, all transactions and feedback are backed by proof of payment on the blockchain.

  "Insufficient Gas Griefing": "Insufficient gas griefing attacks can be performed on contracts which accept data and use it in a sub-call on another contract. If the sub-call fails, either the whole transaction is reverted, or execution is continued. In the case of a relayer contract, the user who executes the transaction, the 'forwarder', can effectively censor transactions by using just enough gas to execute the transaction, but not enough for the sub-call to succeed.

As an insurance protocol, InsurAce will provide two function arms similar as the traditional insurance company, i.e., the insurance arm and investment arm. The free capital in the insurance capital pool can be placed into the investment pool to gain higher yield, while the insurance arm will provide protection to the investment activities. Meanwhile, the yield at the investment side will in turn complement the premium at the insurance side, and further reduce the cover cost for customers. These two parts will in such a synergetic manner to provide “0” premium insurance as well as considerable investment return, forming a sustainable business model. In this model, InsurAce as a platform, will generate revenues from the insurance premium as well as a minor portion of carry from the investment returns.

The system is fully decentralized and there is truly no gatekeeper. No gatekeeper means there is no entity to be regulated.\n\nJohnLawCoin is a real-world experiment to verify one assumption: There is a way to stabilize the currency price with algorithmically defined monetary policies without holding any collateral like USD.\n\nIf JohnLawCoin is successful and proves the assumption is correct, it will provide interesting insights for both non-fiat currencies and fiat currencies; i.e., 1) there is a way for non-fiat cryptocurrencies to implement a stablecoin without having any gatekeeper that holds collateral, and 2) there is a way for developing countries to implement a fixed exchange rate system for their fiat currencies without holding adequate USD reserves. This will upgrade human's understanding about money.\n\nThere are a couple of preceding examples of non-collateralized stablecoins like BasisCoin and Empty Set Dollar but none of the coins has succeeded in stabilizing the currency price in the long run. JohnLawCoin is yet another experiment that attempts to stabilize the currency price by addressing issues of the existing stablecoins.\n",

This is a great security improvement over storing the user keys on a single central server, or even in local storage, which can allow for mass account thefts. This security feature also comes with developer convenience: For developers, they can simply interact with the globally available Klaytn API that identifies the users of caver-compatible browsers (caver is a JavaScript library for Klaytn network, just like web3 for Ethereum), and whenever they request a transaction signature, Kaikas will prompt the user for confirmation. It will keep the user informed. Finally, since keys are not stored centrally, attackers will attempt to phish individual users rather than performing mass hacks. Kaikas comes pre-loaded with nice and fast connections to the Klaytn main network and test network. It allows users to get started without synchronizing a full node, while still providing strong security.\n",

  "Kashi": "A lending and margin trading platform, built upon BentoBox, which allows for anyone to create customized and gas-efficient markets for lending, borrowing, and collateralizing a variety of DeFi tokens, stablecoins, and synthetic assets. Such a broad diversity of tokens is supported through the use of a unique isolated market framework. Unlike traditional DeFi money markets where high-risk assets can introduce risk to the entire protocol, in Kashi, each market is entirely separate in its own (similar to the Sushiswap DEX), meaning the risk of assets within one lending market has no effect over the risk of another lending market. Additionally, this allows for the creation of leveraged short positions within just a single transaction.\n",

These votes are what guide the network’s upgrades. They are also used for proposals and voting on specific parameters of the collateralized debt position (CDP) system.\n",
  "kCompound": "Product of KeeperDAO. kCompound is a wrapper for the Compound lending platform that lets users deposit collateral and borrow assets as they normally would. However, kCompound loans are constantly monitored and protected by the KeeperDAO Just-In-Time Underwriter (JITU), which helps protect borrowers from liquidation. kCompound is, in fact, a first-of-its-kind instrument that encapsulates an entire Compound position in an NFT, the ERC-721 compatible kCompound token.\n\nThe team designed kCompound as an NFT because, despite its many innovations, DeFi borrowing can still be cumbersome. For instance, when using the native Compound protocol, it's impossible to have multiple positions be isolated from each other but tied to the same Ethereum address. As another example, simply moving a Compound position between addresses requires the use of a smart contract and a flash loan, since cTokens can only be transferred if all the loans are cleared.\n\nBy contrast, when users mint a kCompound NFT, they get a unique contract that can be transferred between different Ethereum addresses and easily composed with other DeFi protocols. No matter where it goes, or how it's used, the positions inside the NFT will be protected by KeeperDAO's JITU and Hiding Game, giving kCompound owners the safest and most composable borrowing experience in DeFi.\n",
  "Keep Network": "Censorship resistance protocol for DeFi. A keep stores your data and protects it from censorship, so what you store always stays yours. Products include tBTC, which allows Bitcoin holders deposit and redeem BTC in DeFi without centralized intermediaries.\n",
  "Keep3r Network": "A decentralized keeper network for projects that need external devops and for external teams to find keeper jobs.\n\nA Keeper is the term used to refer to an external person and/or team that executes a job. This can be as simplistic as calling a transaction, or as complex as requiring extensive off-chain logic. The scope of Keep3r network is not to manage these jobs themselves, but to allow contracts to register as jobs for keepers, and keepers to register themselves as available to perform jobs. It is up to the individual keeper to set up their devops and infrastructure and create their own rules based on what transactions they deem profitable.\n\nA Job is the term used to refer to a smart contract that wishes an external entity to perform an action. They would like the action to be performed in \"good will\" and not have a malicious result. For this reason they register as a job, and keepers can then execute on their contract.\n",
  "KeeperDAO": "An on-chain liquidity underwriter for DeFi. Using KeeperDAO, people can pool their assets to earn passive income through liquidations, arbitrage, and other opportunities from all across DeFi.\n\nLiquidity providers deposit assets into KeeperDAO, pooling their assets together to collectively earn profit. Whenever positions go into liquidation on lending protocols, arbitrage appear between DEXs, or other similar opportunities present themselves on-chain, KeeperDAO uses its pool of deposited assets to capture the opportunity and earn profit. In between such opportunities, the pooled assets are lent out on various other DeFi protocol to accrue interest while not being used. This ensures that KeeperDAO is always earning profits to its liquidity providers.\n\nTo guarantee that KeeperDAO wins liquidations and arbitrage, it uses a game-theoretical optimal strategy to submit Ethereum transactions. This ensures that KeeperDAO transactions will be prioritized over other people trying to win the same liquidations and arbitrages. This is known as a priority gas auction (PGA). By using a game-theoretically optimal strategy to PGAs, KeeperDAO ensures that it is more profitable to cooperate than to compete; both KeeperDAO and potential competitors will earn better profits over time by cooperating.\n\nThe PGA it is performed by multiple off-chain bots that constantly watch for liquidations and arbitrage to appear. When it sees these opportunities it engages in the game-theoretically optimal strategy to submit transactions. However, it’s not only these bots that can submit transactions. Anyone can attempt to use KeeperDAO assets. KeeperDAO contracts are permissionless, but enforce that non-profitable transactions are reverted, and incentivise users to return all of their profits.\n",
  "Keepers": "On-chain actors which manage liquidations, rebalances and arbitrage on DeFi applications spanning trading, lending, and exchange. They are responsible for arbitraging between DEXs and liquidating unhealthy accounts on Aave, dYdX, Compound, MakerDAO, and so on. More generally, keepers are on-chain profit seekers that require capital. The KeeperDAO liquidity pool allows keepers to borrow this capital, so long as it is returned within the same transaction.\n\nA major challenge for keepers is engaging in priority gas auctions (PGAs). For example, when they want to capture an arbitrage opportunity, they are not the only one trying to do so, and to have their transaction prioritised requires them to spend a large amount of gas on the transaction. It is not uncommon for PGAs to drain most, if not all, of the profit available in arbitrage and liquidations. KeeperDAO solves this problem, by incentivising keepers to collaborate, instead of compete.\n",

  "Keynesian Economics": "A macroeconomic economic theory of total spending in the economy and its effects on output, employment, and inflation. Keynesian economics was developed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the Great Depression. Keynesian economics is considered a \"demand-side\" theory that focuses on changes in the economy over the short run. Keynes’s theory was the first to sharply separate the study of economic behavior and markets based on individual incentives from the study of broad national economic aggregate variables and constructs.\n\nBased on his theory, Keynes advocated for increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the depression. Subsequently, Keynesian economics was used to refer to the concept that optimal economic performance could be achieved—and economic slumps prevented—by influencing aggregate demand through activist stabilization and economic intervention policies by the government.\n",

  "KUU": "A decentralized protocol designed to provide reinforcing liquidity to on-chain keepers to maximize on-chain profit through liquidations, DEX arbitrage and other on-chain opportunities. At the heart of KUU is a communal liquidity pool which enables users to pool capital into smart contracts to collectively capture value from on-chain arbitrage and liquidation opportunities. Capital staked in these pools (e.g AVAX, USDT) is used to extract on-chain opportunities presented by protocols such as Bonobo, BENQI, bZx and Pangolin. By having a large pool of liquidity, KUU is able to capture opportunities much larger than what could be captured by individuals. Liquidators will be able to get a share of larger opportunities by using the KUU liquidity pool, opportunities that they could not necessarily capture by themselves. It also has the added advantage that contributors to the KUU liquidity pool do not have to run their own infrastructure and bots, making the barrier to entry much lower.\n",
  "KUU Token": "Native token of KUU Protocol. It will allow token-holders to propose and vote on all protocol upgrades, alongside new system proposals. The ultimate goal of KUU is to transition into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) overtime through progressive decentralization. The total supply of $KUU is 25,000,000 tokens.\n",

Infinite liquidity means that traders never have to worry about moving the orderbook and being affected by slippage. Once futures is built on the Synthetix protocol, it will soon be supported on Kwenta, offering perpetual future contracts on a non-custodial, permissionless platform.\n",
  "Kyber Automated Price Reserve": "Highly suited for token teams that want to list their token and individuals who have large token holdings, and is designed with ease of maintenance as the top consideration. Many of the top token teams have already listed their tokens on Kyber by setting up Automated Price Reserves (APRs), including Synthetix, Melon, DAOstack, and Gnosis. The APR relies on Kyber’s pre-defined algorithm set in the smart contract to automatically provide conversion rates for a token. It changes the price of the token based on the trades performed and the ETH/token inventory provided. The APR also provides Reserve managers the ability to set liquidity parameters that suit their specific needs and current market conditions. Kyber APRs provide many benefits for liquidity providers. Apart from providing listed tokens huge exposure to the DeFi ecosystem, APRs allow highly efficient utilisation of token inventory, ultimately ensuring better liquidity and spread and lower slippage compared to other platforms, even for large orders.\n",
  "Kyber Bridge Reserve": "Specialized reserves meant to bring liquidity from other on-chain liquidity providers like Uniswap and Oasis into Kyber network.\n",
  "Kyber Community Pool": "A KNC delegation pool made by the community. With the community pool, users will be able to deposit their KNC into the pool and let the pool master do all the hard work. The KNC users deposit will never be in our control. Additionally, any fees earned by the user are also never in our control all thanks to Protofire’s trustless smart contact proxy. Claiming your rewards from the pool is very simple and requires very little effort! You can let the rewards continue to pile up, or redeem them regularly. Nevertheless, all that you’ll have to do to redeem your rewards is initiate a Web3 transaction on the main Kyber Community Pool website by entering how much of the rewards you’d like to redeem, and click “Redeem”.\n",
  "Kyber Fed Price Reserve": "Uniquely designed to allow professional market makers (MMs) or advanced developers to effectively market-make and generate profits on-chain. Market makers running Fed Price Reserve (FPRs) provide liquidity for about 70% — 80% of all trades happening on Kyber. FPRs provide a strong set of advantages that make market making for a wide range of tokens profitable and feasible. These advantages include high capital/gas efficiency, immediate exposure to the widest set of takers in DeFi, exact control over pricing strategies and risk exposure, and a range of safety mechanisms. An example of how Kyber FPRs allow for a much higher capital efficiency compared to other on-chain systems: reserve operators can use the same quote currency inventory to market-make for up to 14 tokens. In contrast, for AMMs and orderbook systems, a separate quote currency inventory will need to be set aside for every different token or order.\n",
  "Kyber Network": "A blockchain-based liquidity protocol that aggregates liquidity from a wide range of reserves, powering instant and secure token exchange in any decentralized application. Through an open reserve architecture, individuals, token teams and professional market makers can contribute token assets to their liquidity pool and earn from the spread in every trade. These tokens become available at the best rates across DApps that tap into the network, making them instantly more liquid and useful. At the other end, takers access liquidity for multiple use cases. For example, vendors are able to accept payment in multiple tokens on their e-commerce platforms yet receive in their preferred token. DApps can also allow users who are not their token holders to utilize their services with other tokens, and DeFi projects can rebalance their token portfolio instantly. The protocol is open source and governed by the KyberDAO, a decentralized community of KNC token holders who stake their tokens and collectively vote and decide on key protocol parameters. Transactions on Kyber are fully on-chain and thus fully transparent and verifiable.\n",
  "Kyber Network Crystal": "Kyber Network Crystal (KNC) is an ERC-20 utility token and an integral part of Kyber Network. KNC allows token holders to play a critical role in determining the incentive system, building a wide base of stakeholders, and facilitating economic flow in the network. A small fee is charged each time a token exchange happens on the network, and KNC holders get to vote on this fee model and distribution, as well as other important decisions. Over time, as more trades are executed, additional fees will be generated for staking rewards and reserve rebates, while more KNC will be burned.\n",
  "Kyber Network Tracker": "Analytics platform to track Kyber Network’s Trades, Activities, and Burnt Fees.\n",

Intuitive search and a decentralised scoring system enable users to work together with confidence, and a dispute resolution mechanism ensures fast and cost-effective arbitration of disputes if necessary.\n",
  "Lack of Proper Signature Verification": "A type of Access Control vulnerability. It is a common pattern for smart contract systems to allow users to sign messages off-chain instead of directly requesting users to do an on-chain transaction because of the flexibility and increased transferability that this provides. Smart contract systems that process signed messages have to implement their own logic to recover the authenticity from the signed messages before they process them further. A limitation for such systems is that smart contracts can not directly interact with them because they can not sign messages. Some signature verification implementations attempt to solve this problem by assuming the validity of a signed message based on other methods that do not have this limitation. An example of such a method is to rely on msg.sender and assume that if a signed message originated from the sender address then it has also been created by the sender address. This can lead to vulnerabilities especially in scenarios where proxies can be used to relay transactions.\n",
  "Lambo": "Shorthand for Lamborghini, an exotic car that people often refer to in their excitement over getting rich from cryptocurrencies. Often used in cryptocurrency communities when asking when prices may rise again by saying “When Lambo?” It is usually combined with “When moon?”\n",

  "Lava Cash": "A decentralized privacy protocol built on the Solana blockchain utilizing zk-STARKs to break any deterministic links between funds that have entered the \"Lava Pool\" from those that have exited.\n",
  "Layer 2": "A collective term for solutions designed to help DApp developers scale their DApps by handling transactions off the main Ethereum chain (layer 1). Transaction speed suffers when the network is busy which can make the user experience poor for certain types of DApps. And as the network gets busier, gas prices increase as transaction senders aim to outbid each other. This can make using Ethereum very expensive.\n\nLayer 2 is needed because of the following reasons:\n\n Some use-cases, like blockchain games, make no sense with current transaction times\n It can be unnecessarily expensive to use blockchain applications\n Any updates to scalability should not be at the expense of decentralization of security – layer 2 builds on top of Ethereum\n\nMost layer 2 solutions are centered around a server or cluster of servers, each of which may be referred to as a node, validator, operator, sequencer, block producer, or similar term. Depending on the implementation, these layer 2 nodes may be run by the businesses or entities that use them, or by a 3rd party operator, or by a large group of individuals (similar to mainnet). Generally speaking, transactions are submitted to these layer 2 nodes instead of being submitted directly to layer 1 (mainnet); the layer 2 instance then batches them into groups before anchoring them to layer 1, after which they are secured by layer 1 and cannot be altered. The details of how this is done vary significantly between different layer 2 technologies and implementations.\n\nA specific Layer 2 instance may be open and shared by many applications, or may be deployed by one company and dedicated to supporting only their application.\n",
  "LAYER Token": "Native token of Unilayer protocol. Unilayer’s Flash Staking Model is designed to reward all parties holding LAYER and the ERC20 token being staked.

  "Legal Trust Assets ": "Trustless issuance & trusted settlement\n",
  "Legitimacy": "A pattern of higher-order acceptance. An outcome in some social context is legitimate if the people in that social context broadly accept and play their part in enacting that outcome, and each individual person does so because they expect everyone else to do the same.\n\nLegitimacy is a phenomenon that arises naturally in coordination games. If you're not in a coordination game, there's no reason to act according to your expectation of how other people will act, and so legitimacy is not important. But as we have seen, coordination games are everywhere in society, and so legitimacy turns out to be quite important indeed. In almost any environment with coordination games that exists for long enough, there inevitably emerge some mechanisms that can choose which decision to take. These mechanisms are powered by an established culture that everyone pays attention to these mechanisms and (usually) does what they say. Each person reasons that because everyone else follows these mechanisms, if they do something different they will only create conflict and suffer, or at least be left in a lonely forked ecosystem all by themselves. If a mechanism successfully has the ability to make these choices, then that mechanism has legitimacy.\n\nIn any context where there's a coordination game that has existed for long enough, there's likely a conception of legitimacy. And blockchains are full of coordination games. Which client software do you run? Which decentralized domain name registry do you ask for which address corresponds to a .eth name? Which copy of the Uniswap contract do you accept as being \"the\" Uniswap exchange? Even NFTs are a coordination game. The two largest parts of an NFT's value are (i) pride in holding the NFT and ability to show off your ownership, and (ii) the possibility of selling it in the future. For both of these components, it's really really important that whatever NFT you buy is recognized as legitimate by everyone else. In all of these cases, there's a great benefit to having the same answer as everyone else, and the mechanism that determines that equilibrium has a lot of power.\n",

  "Lightning Network": "A decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that removes the risk of delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties. Bitcoin, the world's most widely used and valuable digital currency, allows anyone to send value without a trusted intermediary or depository. Bitcoin contains an advanced scripting system allowing users to program instructions for funds. There are, however, some drawbacks to bitcoin's decentralized design. Transactions confirmed on the bitcoin blockchain take up to one hour before they are irrevesible. Micropayments, or payments less than a few cents, are inconsistently confirmed, and fees render such transactions unviable on the network today. The Lightning Network solves these problems. It is one of the first implementations of a multi-party Smart Contract (programmable money) using bitcoin's built-in scripting. The Lightning Network is leading technological development in multiparty financial computations with bitcoin.\n",

  "Limit Order": "A type of order to purchase or sell a security at a specified price or better. For buy limit orders, the order will be executed only at the limit price or a lower one, while for sell limit orders, the order will be executed only at the limit price or a higher one. This stipulation allows traders to better control the prices they trade. By using a buy limit order, the investor is guaranteed to pay that price or less. While the price is guaranteed, the filling of the order is not, and limit orders will not be executed unless the security price meets the order qualifications. If the asset does not reach the specified price, the order is not filled and the investor may miss out on the trading opportunity. This can be contrasted with a market order, whereby a trade is executed at the prevailing market price without any price limit specified.\n",
  "Linen App": "Investing app and a crypto wallet that allows access to DeFi interest pools.\n",
  "Link My Ride": "A decentralized vehicle rental platform powered by Chainlink and Ethereum. In the past, Smart Contracts have been integrated with electric vehicles via the use of specialized hardware that plugs directly into the vehicle to obtain real-time data. Not only were these examples restricted to just accessing data, but they also didn't scale well, as each vehicle requires special hardware installed. Tesla electric vehicles have a proper feature rich API that can be leveraged to obtain vehicle data & change the state of the vehicle, which then gives us the ability to create a custom external adapter to connect Smart Contracts to the vehicle via a Chainlink Oracle, giving the Smart Contract full access to the given vehicles data & ability to change its state. This example demonstrates the design pattern described above, applying it to the use case of the peer to peer sharing economy. In traditional vehicle rental platforms, the vehicle renter relies on the 'brand power' of the company renting the vehicles, and trusts that the bond they submit will be returned if they adhered to the conditions. And as a vehicle owner/provider, going through a trusted centralized platform usually requires sacrificing approximately 30% of revenue earned. But in a peer to peer scenario, both renter and owner are strangers, there is no 'brand power', and there's no guarantee any bond paid will be returned fairly if agreement conditions are met. This is where a Smart contract connected to external data and events can be leveraged to facilitate a digital agreement between a Vehicle Owner & Vehicle Renter in a trust minimized & secure way.\n",

  "Liquidity ": "The trade-off between speed of sale and the price an asset can be sold or bought for. Inefficiency in the process leads to slippage for the buyer/seller. \n",
  "Liquidity Fragmentation": "In the crypto world, trading happens all over the world, and the system is quite divided. There are hundreds of exchanges and tokens of different nature. The divided system results in liquidity issues, where it is difficult for traders to connect with each other and agree on a price. This is liquidity fragmentation. For example, Bitcoin and Ethereum are popular and they find their places mostly on all crypto exchanges. However, there are hundreds of other small tokens that get listed only on a few exchanges.\n\nThe price of a token is different across the different exchanges, and traders experience challenges. If there is an issue of liquidity, it is difficult for traders to enter or exit the market. The lack of liquidity adds to the existing problems like the need for multiple accounts on multiple exchanges, different fee structures, a lack of trading pairs, etc.\n\nLet’s say that Alice got lucky and acquired some newly issued tokens from a giveaway. Excited, she might want to exchange them for another token or fiat money. Unfortunately, there’s only a few places where these tokens are listed. Also, due to the lack of a unified marketplace, she faces issues to sell or exchange her tokens for a good price, since the market is fragmented among the different platforms, each with a scarcity of buyers and sellers. To fix this issue, called Liquidity Fragmentation, there are services dedicated exclusively to connect traders across the market to allow them to reach good offers.\n",
  "Liquidity Mining": "The act of supplying liquidity to a protocol to earn provider fees, and additional incentives, including but not limited to governance tokens.\n",
  "Liquidity Network": "A 2nd layer solution, built upon the NOCUST protocol, a scalably secure commit-chain. A commit-chain is similar to a side-chain, but doesn’t require an additional consensus mechanism and solely relies on the security of its parent-chain. A commit-chain is a chain of commits ⛓️, that means that NOCUST is committing regularly, every round, a commit of the commit-chain to the parent Ethereum chain. The commit-chain is run by a non-custodial hub, or operator, and clients communicate with the hub. Contrary to side-chains, commit-chains don't need an additional consensus mechanism and rely on the security of the parent chain (here Ethereum).\n",
  "Liquidity Pool": "The aggregated cryptoassets supplied and available for trade in a single contract. All deposits are combined, and are represented with proportional ownership tracking tokens issued to the depositors. Fees gathered on trades are distributed inside this pool and grow the value of the tracking token over time.\n\n",
  "Liquidity Provider": "A user or institution who funds a liquidity pool with crypto assets they own to facilitate trading on the platform and earn passive income on their deposit. Liquidity pools are leveraged by the decentralized exchanges that use automated market maker-based systems to allow trading of illiquid trading pairs with limited slippage. Instead of using traditional order book-based trading systems, such exchanges use funds that are held for every asset in every trading pair to allow trades to be executed. While trading illiquid trading pairs on order book-based exchanges could lead to suffering from great slippage and the inability to execute trades, the advantage of liquidity providers is that trades can always be executed as long as the liquidity pools are big enough. For this reason, liquidity providers are seen as trade facilitators and paid with the transaction fees paid for the trades that they enabled. How much liquidity providers are paid is based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that they provide. When funding the pool, they are usually required to fund two different assets to enable traders to switch between one to the other by trading them in pairs.\n",
  "Liquity": "A decentralized protocol that allows Ether holders to obtain maximum liquidity against their collateral without paying interest. After locking up ETH as collateral in a smart contract and creating an individual position called a \"trove\", the user can get instant liquidity by minting LUSD, a USD-pegged stablecoin. Each trove is required to be collateralized at a minimum of 110%. Any owner of LUSD can redeem their stablecoins for the underlying collateral at any time. The redemption mechanism along with algorithmically adjusted fees guarantee a minimum stablecoin value of $1.\n\nAn unprecedented liquidation mechanism based on incentivized stability deposits and a redistribution cycle from riskier to safer troves provides stability at a much lower collateral ratio than current systems. Stability is maintained via economically-driven user interactions and arbitrage, rather than by active governance or monetary interventions. The protocol has built-in incentives that encourage both early adoption and the operation of multiple front ends, enhancing decentralization.\n",

  "Liveliness": "A metric which provides insights into shifts in macro HODLing behaviour, helping to identify trends in long term holder accumulation or spending. It highlights periods where coin days are being destroyed at a rate faster than the global network is accumulating them.\n\nEvery day the network will accumulate one coin day per unit of circulating supply. Simultaneously, some of those coin days will be spent and destroyed in transactions, resetting the moved coins lifespan to zero. Liveliness is calculated by taking the ratio of cumulative coin days destroyed to the cumulative sum of all coin days ever accumulated by the network.\n\nLiveliness to vary between a value of 1 for a protocol where every coin is spent at once, and 0 for a protocol where no transaction has taken place. Analysis of metric values between the theoretical extremes of 1 and 0 can generally be considered within the following framework:\n\n Liveliness will decrease when a high proportion of coin supply is dormant (i.e. HODLing behaviour) and the global coin day accumulation outpaces coin days destroyed in on-chain activity.\n Liveliness will trend sideways where coin days destroyed are equal to the coin days accumulated by the circulating supply.\n Liveliness will increase when long term holders begin spending old coins that have accumulated large volumes of coin days that exceed the rate of global coin day accumulation.\n\nThe Liveliness metric can also be used to assign relative weight and confidence over the value of market cap valuations. Liveliness will be close to zero for assets with low liquidity and poor adoption but high market cap (either through pre-mined coins or wash transactions of the same units).\n\nMetric is coined by Tamas Blummer in December 2018.\n",

  "Locked Ether": "Ethereum smart contracts can, as any account on Ethereum, receive Ether. However, there as several reasons for which the received funds might get locked permanently into the contract. One reason is that the contract may depend on another contract which has been destructed using the SELFDESTRUCT instruction of the EVM — i.e. its code has been removed and its funds transferred. If this was the only way for such a contract to send Ether, it will result in the funds being permanently locked. This is what happened in the Parity Wallet bug in November 2017, locking millions of USD worth of Ether. There are also cases where the contract will always run out of gas when trying to send Ether which could result in locking the contract funds.\n",
  "LON Token": "A utility token issued by Tokenlon, used to align all parties involved in the ecosystem and incentivize participation and expansion of the ecosystem.

  "LPL Token": "Utility token for LinkPool. To earn LINK rewards, users are required to stake their LPL within the owners' pool. The rewards are distributed proportionately to all the current stakers as they are sent to the contract. For holders who do not stake their LPL token, they will miss any rewards, and the claimable LINK:LPL ratio will increase for the current stakers.\n\nWhen users stake their LPL tokens in the owners pool, they will receive an equivalent amount of \"allowance tokens\" or LPLA tokens. Once staking is released, users will stake their linkLPLA alongside LINK to gain access to the pool. The more assets LinkPool support in staking that requires an allowance, the more allowance token variants that they will mint.\n\nAn interesting aspect of this is that the LPLA tokens are ERC20, and that holders don't need both LPL and LPLA to stake. If holders have a balance of LPLA, then they can use that to stake in the LinkPool node without first having a balance within the owners pool. Although it's very important to note that to withdraw LPL from the owners pool, users need to provide all of their allowance tokens to unwind the LPL.\n\nThis creates a scenario where there may be both liquidity in the LPL and LPLA tokens, where one may opt to simply swap assets into LPLA to gain a staking allowance, with LPL holders needing to buy back any sold allowance to withdraw LPL out of the pool. The core reason for gating access to each pool with an allowance token is the ability to respond to demand for collateral while preventing dilution of yield for those already staking in the pool. After the launch of staking, the more work LinkPool's Chainlink node gets, the more collateral it demands, the more LINK can be put to work, and the larger the LINK:LPLA ratio can grow, meaning the more each staker can stake.\n",

This is why the team has tied the ETH price of a Luchador NFT directly to the value of the LINK fee, to ensure their prices are fair and everyone can get in on the action. The Luchador smart contract will use Uniswap V2 Router to automatically convert users' ETH to LINK to fund the random number generator. A 5% slippage is also included in the price.\n\nEach Luchador has 8 possible attributes: mask, mouth, cape, torso, arms, bottoms, boots, spirit. The random number generated by Chainlink VRF will determine how each Luchador looks and its rarity. Primary, secondary, eye and skin colour are also determined by the random number. There are millions of possible rare attributes and colour combinations.\n",

These beautiful artworks live on the Ethereum blockchain in form of ERC-721 tokens and will be hosted on IPFS.\n\nLucky Manekis are magical creatures that inhabit the legendary world of Luckeania. In that mystical domain, out of the energies of good fortune and prosperity, the first 40 Lucky Manekis were born. Also known as the Epic Manekis, they are truly a rare sighting. Over the centuries, Epic Manekis have developed as species and grew its population to 14,159.\n\nThe descendants share the combined energies and lucky traits of the Epic Manekis but sometimes the lucky traits were inherited with fortuitous mutations that made them rarer than others. Recently, Manekis have discovered the NFT technology and asked our team to wrap them into NFTs and bring their powerful luck and good fortune to enterprising collectors.\n",

  "LUSD Token": "The USD-pegged stablecoin used to pay out loans on the Liquity protocol. At any time, it can be redeemed against the underlying collateral at face value.\n\nThe ability to redeem LUSD for ETH at face value (i.e. 1 LUSD for $1 of ETH) and the minimum collateral ratio of 110% creates a price floor and price ceiling (respectively) through arbitrage opportunities. The team call these \"hard peg mechanisms\" since they are based on direct processes.\n\nLUSD also benefits from less direct mechanisms for USD parity — called \"soft peg mechanisms\". One of these mechanisms is parity as a Schelling point. Since Liquity treats LUSD as being equal to USD, parity between the two is an implied equilibrium state of the protocol. Another of these mechanisms is the borrowing fee on new debts. As redemptions increase (implying LUSD is below $1), so too does the baseRate — making borrowing less attractive which keeps new LUSD from hitting the market and driving the price below $1.\n",
  "LVN Token": "Liven's network currency. LVN is used to reward users for experiencing Liven Merchant / Partner Venues and is a valid payment method and donation instrument within the Liven Network to be used just like regular money.\n",

The reduced risk allows LPs to feel comfortable to provide deeper liquidity, yielding more trading volume and higher fees.\n",
  "M1": "The second layer of money, where collateral becomes fractionalized. \n",
  "M2": "A calculation of the money supply that includes all elements of M1 as well as \"near money.\" M1 includes cash and checking deposits, while near money refers to savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits.\n\nM2 is a broader money classification than M1 because it includes assets that are highly liquid but are not cash. A consumer or business typically doesn't use savings deposits and other non-M1 components of M2 when making purchases or paying bills, but it could convert them to cash in relatively short order. M1 and M2 are closely related, and economists like to include the more broadly defined definition for M2 when discussing the money supply, because modern economies often involve transfers between different account types. For example, a business may transfer $10,000 from a money market account to its checking account. This transfer would increase M1, which doesn’t include money market funds, while keeping M2 stable, since M2 contains money market accounts.\n\nM2 as a measurement of the money supply is a critical factor in the forecasting of issues like inflation. Inflation and interest rates have major ramifications for the general economy, as these heavily influence employment, consumer spending, business investment, currency strength, and trade balances. In the United States, the Federal Reserve publishes money supply data every Thursday at 4:30 p.m., but this only covers M1 and M2. Data on large time deposits, institutional money market funds, and other large liquid assets are published on a quarterly basis and are included in the M3 money supply measurement.\n\nIn the United States, the Federal Reserve's dual mandate is to balance unemployment and inflation. One of the ways it does this is by manipulating M2 money supply. M2 provides important insight into the direction, extremity, and efficacy of central bank policy. M2 has grown along with the economy, rising from $4.6 trillion in January 2000 to $18.45 trillion in August 2020. The supply never shrank year-over-year (YOY) at any point in that period. The most extreme growth occurred in September 2001, January 2009, and January 2012, when the rate of M2 expansion topped 10%. These accelerated periods coincided with recessions and economic weakness, during which expansionary monetary policy was deployed by the central bank.\n",

Architecturally, the beauty of Matic is its elegant design, which features a generic validation layer separated from varying execution environments like Plasma-enabled chains, full-blown EVM sidechains, and in the future, other Layer 2 approaches such as Optimistic Rollups. Currently, developers can use Plasma for specific state transitions for which Plasma predicates have been written such as ERC20, ERC721, asset swaps or other custom predicates. For arbitrary state transitions, they can use PoS. Or both! This is made possible by Matic's hybrid construction. To enable the PoS mechanism on our platform, a set of staking management contracts are deployed on Ethereum, as well as a set of incentivized validators running Heimdall and Bor nodes.

After selecting high-quality projects, the MCN project screening team will take the initiative to contact project team members for further cooperation.\n\nUnlike traditional VCs where several partners share the return on investments, MCN distributes the investment profits to both GPs/LPs with equity and community builders without equity who contribute to the development of the community. Sharing the rich benefits of VC investment with more community builders can encourage more people to enter the MCN investment and development ecosystem.\n\nThis investment return profit distribution method is realized by simultaneously introducing the DAO equity investment + MCN token issuance model. MCN tokens will be airdropped to all community builders who contribute to the development of the community, and a proportion of the USDC gained from MCN investment will be distributed to holders of DAO shares and holders of MCN tokens.\n\nTraditional VCs are wealth-sharing clubs for a few people, shutting out everyone else. MCN Ventures aims to establish a decentralized VC model in which everyone can participate and achieve maximum growth. Any individual, no matter who you are or where you’re from, no matter your background, nationality or race, can become an important part of MCN through active participation and hard work, sharing some of the greatest investment returns. Major decisions of MCN are made by GPs/LPs through DAO voting, including the appointment of new GPs/LPs and changes to existing GPs/LPs. GPs vote to complete the investment decisions on projects to ensure the MCN fund continues to maximize returns.\n",

  "Median Spent Output Lifespan": "The median lifespan (in days) of all spent transaction outputs. Median Spent Output Lifespan (MSOL) highlights on a macro level the median lifespan of coins on a per transaction output basis that were spent that day. This provides insight into the balance between short-term (young coins) and long-term (old coins) spending behaviour over a period of time.\n\nGenerally speaking, MSOL can be considered in the following framework:\n\n MSOL provides a less sensitive view than Average Spent Output Lifespan (ASOL) and provides insight on the largest cross section of spenders. It deviates less from its baseline (which is dominated by day-to-day traffic, primarily young coins) except during periods of very high volatility where old coins are more likely to be spent.\n High values typically indicate an increased proportion of network traffic are old coins being spent, often associated with long term holders taking advantage of high market volatility.\n Low values typically indicate day-to-day traffic comprised mainly of young coins being spent, often associated with traders and short term holders.\n\nNote that MSOL account only for the lifespan of the spent outputs and does not consider coin volume moved (i.e. ignores how many BTC units are moved). Two outputs which are 100-days old but worth 0.1BTC and 100BTC respectively, have identical weights in the MSOL calculation.\n\nMSOL (Median Spent Output Lifespan) is defined as the median age (in days) of all spent transaction outputs in a given time period. In order to account for change and eliminate obvious relay transactions, outputs with a lifespan of less than 1 hour are discarded.\n\nCoined by Renato Shirakashi in October 2019.\n",
  "Medicalchain": "A decentralised platform that enables secure, fast and transparent exchange and usage of medical data. Our aim is to put the patient in control of their medical data, giving them the power to share the single, most comprehensive version of their record, with every organisation in their medical network.

  "Meme Protocol": "A decentralized protocol for farming NFTs. With MEME, instead of farming for yield like most DeFi projects, users stake assets to earn limited edition NFTs from some of the top artists in the Ethereum space. Each user can stake a maximum of 5 $MEME tokens. In return, they receive points (expressed in Pineapples) which they can redeem against the NFTs available on the platform. As you might imagine, not all NFTs are equal. There are different categories like \"Relic\", \"Common\", \"Rare\", which determine how many pineapple points the NFT costs. If you want a \"Rare\" NFT for instance you need to stake your $MEME for 30 days provided you’re staking the maximum of 5 $MEME tokens. A \"Relic\" NFT on the other hand, can be obtained in less than a day. The fourth, ultra-rare \"Legendary\" category can only be farmed if you provide liquidity on the $MEME/ETH trading pair on Uniswap and stake the Uniswap LP tokens. This farming pool is called Genesis LP, whereas the standard staking is called Genesis. This mechanism creates scarcity and hype around certain NFTs. The interesting thing is that because these NFTs are Ethereum tokens they can be immediately traded on the secondary market.\n",

Although DANK is an ERC20 token standard and therefore interchangeable, the actual memes themselves are ERC721 standard, more commonly referred to as Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs). This allows for unique identification, ownership, and provable rarity for every meme created on the Meme Factory platform. The platform is the third district on the district0x network.\n",
  "Memnonic Phrase": "A list of words which store all the information needed to recover Bitcoin funds on-chain.

  "Message call with hardcoded gas amount": "The transfer() and send() functions forward a fixed amount of 2300 gas. Historically, it has often been recommended to use these functions for value transfers to guard against reentrancy attacks. However, the gas cost of EVM instructions may change significantly during hard forks which may break already deployed contract systems that make fixed assumptions about gas costs. For example. EIP 1884 broke several existing smart contracts due to a cost increase of the SLOAD instruction. Avoid the use of transfer() and send() and do not otherwise specify a fixed amount of gas when performing calls. Use .call.value(...)(\"\") instead.

  "MetaVault": "A \"meta\" yield aggregator that chooses the best yield farming strategy for you on yAxis protocol. This will be a single vault that is platform-agnostic and takes advantage of other aggregator/vault products such as yVaults, APY.finance, pJars, etc. The MetaVault isn’t comparable to something like a yVault; it operates a layer above these strategies where it harvests yield and switches automatically to a better opportunity.\n",
  "MetaVault Token": "Token that represents the user's share of the MetaVault.  The MVLT token is analogous to yVault yTokens (ie yDAI for the yearn DAI vault). Behind the scenes, MVLT will accrue value as the MetaVault puts the deposited funds to work in the best yield aggregator strategy.  This will all be done while pooling gas, which will decrease fees that often eat away at rewards, especially for smaller depositors. When a better strategy presents itself, the MetaVault will convert deposited funds into the appropriate asset and deposit into the appropriate yield aggregator. For example, the vault may choose to switch from the DAI yVault to the sCRV pJar by withdrawing DAI from the yVault, converting DAI to sCRV, and depositing sCRV into pJar. When users wish to withdraw their funds, they simply return their MVLT to the MetaVault, which will then distribute their deposits plus interest. Users can choose to withdraw into any stable coin.\n",
  "Metaverse": "A collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual space, including the sum of all virtual worlds, augmented reality, and the Internet.

  "Meter": "A DeFi infrastructure with a built-in, crypto-native, metastable currency. It functions as a highly-decentralized, high-performance EVM compatible side chain for Ethereum and other public chains. The Meter system uses Proof of Work to create a fully-decentralized, low-volatility coin MTR for fees and payments, and HotStuff-based Proof of Stake with the MTRG governance coin to validate transactions. This hybrid consensus mechanism makes Meter fast - the system can process thousands of transactions per second, reaching finality almost instantly - and super secure.

  "Migration Mining": "A new form of incentive for crypto projects to get liquidity into a liquidity dependent protocol.\n",
  "Mimblewimble": "A blockchain protocol that allows for a completely private transaction platform through a unique security framework that is markedly different from that of the pseudonymous Bitcoin cryptocurrency. In Mimblewimble, there are no addresses and transactions are fully confidential. Its distributed ledger is also relatively more compact than the other chains in the crypto space.\n\nMimblewimble’s transaction structure is derived from \"confidential transactions,\" which were first discussed by Blockstream’s Dr. Adam Back, incidentally also a Satoshi Nakamoto frontrunner. This method is also used in other privacy coins like Monero. \n\nTo elaborate, it all begins with a private transaction where the amount of a given token a sender wants to process is encrypted by way of \"blinding factors.\" Blinding factors refer to random values chosen by a sender which a receiver has to choose from. If the receiver selects a similar value, then the transaction is deemed valid.\n\nIn Mimblewimble, blinding factors have to be chosen by a sender. This way, it functions like a proof of ownership for the receiver, authorizing them to use the coins.\n",
  "Mindful": "Platform that creates auto-rebalancing portfolios and implement mindful DCA strategies while automatically taking profits on the way up.\n",
  "MindSwap": "An automated market maker (AMM) build on top of PredIQt. MindSwap allows users to easily trade in prediction markets with constant liquidity and a simple, easy-to-use interface. MindSwap represents the next generation of blockchain-powered prediction markets and an important step towards mass adoption and extremely easy user experience.\n\nUsing MindSwap, users can wrap PredIQt share tokens in such a way that they become tradeable tokens on EOS. \nThese PredIQt tokens are then deposited into liquidity pools along with an equal amount of another asset like IQ. From there they'll earn a 0.7% transaction fee anytime someone uses the pool to trade between IQ and the PredIQt tokens. This can all be done in a few minutes through the MindSwap user interface. Liquidity providers can withdraw their tokens from the pool at any time and convert their PredIQt tokens back into PredIQt shares. \nFront-end users, on the other hand, simply gain the ability to easily purchase shares in a market by swapping them for another token in a quick transaction. These users aren't required to participate in any of the back-end pool infrastructure.\n\nOne issue that MindSwap solves better than existing AMMs is impermanent loss of divergent assets like prediction market shares. Typically, assets that tend toward 1 or 0 in price have high degrees of impermanent loss due to the natural movement of the share token against the trading token. MindSwap smoothes out this issue with a higher fee to liquidity providers. This is why the current 0.7% fee is used as compared to the standard .6%. As they implement more sophisticated bonding curves and AMM features, they will be able to tackle impermanent loss in a more efficient way and lower fees to encourage more traders.\n",
  "Mineable": "Some cryptocurrencies have a system through which miners can be rewarded with newly-created cryptocurrencies for creating blocks through contributing their hash power. Cryptocurrencies with this ability to generate new cryptocurrencies through the process of confirmation is said to be mineable.\n",
  "Miner Extractable Value": "Value that is harvested by miners directly from smart contracts as cryptocurrency profits.

  "Minimal Viable Proof of Stake": "Consensus algorithm for Trustlines Network. Validators are pseudo-anonymous in this consensus algorithm. Introducing pseudo-anonymous validators creates the need to ensure that no entity can get 51% of the voting power. Popular Proof of Stake chains with pseudo-anonymous validators, like Ethereum 2.0, can achieve this because it would be prohibitively expensive to buy 51% of the voting power. A new and unknown blockchain, such as the Trustlines Blockchain, cannot prevent a 51% attack the same way. To prevent this kind of attack, mPoS is designed to place additional restrictions on validators. These validators are defined through a validator auction. The participants of the auction need to be part of a whitelisted, Sybil-resistant set of candidates. Bids are made using Trustlines Network Token (TLN). At the end of the auction, TLN from winning bids are staked on the Ethereum blockchain for nine months. It is important that validators stake some amount of TLN, to prevent certain attacks. If validators misbehave, their stake can get \"slashed.\" In other words, the validator's TLN deposit can be automatically rendered inaccessible. Under mPoS, staking and slashing features prevent validator equivocation. This is an attack in which a validator uses their private key to sign two or more different blocks with the same step number, irrespective of the block's height, validity, or other fields. Adding the mPoS features creates a consensus algorithm with sufficient safety measures for TLBC.\n",

  "Minimum Viable Product": "That version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. This validated learning comes in the form of whether your customers will actually purchase your product.\n",
  "Mining": "A process in which transactions for various forms of cryptocurrency are verified and added to the blockchain digital ledger. Each time a cryptocurrency transaction is made, a cryptocurrency miner is responsible for ensuring the authenticity of information and updating the blockchain with the transaction. The mining process itself involves competing with other cryptominers to solve complicated mathematical problems with cryptographic hash functions that are associated with a block containing the transaction data. The first cryptocurrency miner to crack the code is rewarded by being able to authorize the transaction, and in return for the service provided, cryptominers earn small amounts of cryptocurrency of their own. In order to be competitive with other cryptominers, though, a cryptocurrency miner needs a computer with specialized hardware.\n",
  "Mining Pool": "A setup where multiple miners combine their computing power to gain economies of scale and competitiveness in finding the next block on a blockchain. Rewards are split according to different agreements, depending on the mining pool. Another term for this is Group Mining.\n",

  "MiningDAO": "A protocol aiming to make block production on Ethereum transparent, trustless, and decentralized. The most urgent use-case is miner-extractable value (\"MEV\"). The protocol allows anyone to propose entire blocks to be mined, with a reward attached for mining them. Mining pools can select the blocks with highest rewards, all without ever knowing the actual contents of the proposed blocks. They expect MiningDAO to be the most profitable choice for mining pools due to enhanced opportunities for earning MEV. Compared to existing systems, MiningDAO minimizes reliance on centralized servers and assumptions of honest miner behavior.\n\nMiningDAO is building a decentralized and transparent protocol for block formation, where the same rules apply to everyone. They propose an open-source, modular infrastructure, with no secretive lock-in components, where all miners and all block producers participate on equal footing. Anyone with an Ethereum address can propose the next block to be mined (via a block sealhash), and attach a bounty for successfully mining it. The mining pools would then mine on the highest-bounty proposal, brute-forcing nonces while remaining oblivious to the actual contents of the block. Other than putting everyone on equal footing in relation to MEV, this design greatly increases Ethereum's censorship resistance.\n",
  "Minion": "A short extension that interacts with the Moloch v2/LAO smart contract. At its core, Minion is an escrow program that receives funding from a DAO. However, the Minion can only transfer funds to another Ethereum address after it has been authorized by DAO members via their proposal sequence — a true programmatic proxy. Through Minion, Moloch-based DAOs will be able to seamlessly create sub-groups of DAOs, which enable DAO members to segregate and pool funds in a way that will protect investors, manage tax risk, and potentially also decrease the risk of fraud. They also open up the possibility of creating DAOs to interact with liquidity pools.\n",
  "Mintable": "A marketplace to buy and sell digital items on the blockchain (NFTs also known as ERC-721s).

By collecting it, collectors become patrons and unlock exclusive features and perks.\n\nMinty's unique digital patronage program democratises the curation process and allows artists to find their tribes and followers earlier on. Minty lets artists and collectors be themselves - powering creativity and bringing colours to this world.\n",
  "Mirror": "A decentralized, user-owned, crypto-based publishing platform that revolutionizes the way we express, share and monetize our thoughts.\n",
  "Mirror Protocol": "A DeFi protocol powered by smart contracts on the Terra network that enables the creation of synthetic assets called Mirrored Assets (mAssets). mAssets mimic the price behavior of real-world assets and give traders anywhere in the world open access to price exposure without the burdens of owning or transacting real assets.\n\nThe minting of mAssets is decentralized and is undertaken by users throughout the network by opening a position and depositing collateral. Mirror ensures that there is always sufficient collateral within the protocol to cover mAssets, and also manages markets for mAssets by listing them on Terraswap against UST.\n",
  "Mirror Token": "The Mirror Token (MIR) is Mirror Protocol's governance token. Currently, it must be staked to vote on active polls and is required as a deposit for making new governance polls. In future iterations of Mirror, it will serve further purposes for the protocol that increase its utility and value.\n\nUsers that stake MIR tokens also earn MIR rewards generated from withdrawing collateral from CDP positions within the protocol.\n\nMIR is also used to incentivize users to farm yields by staking LP tokens which were minted by providing liquidity for MIR and mAssets. Yield is paid to the users from MIRs that are newly minted through annual inflation, which gradually increases the total supply of MIR until the end of 4th year.\n",
  "Mirror Wallet": "A fully non-custodial wallet maintained by ATQ Capital ( https://atqcapital.com ) — launches with a trading experience to rival the $11 billion-valued stock trading app Robinhood. Mirror Wallet allows users to purchase synthetic assets tracking the prices of the 12 most popular US technology stocks, including Apple, Google, Tesla, Netflix, Twitter, Microsoft Corporation, Amazon, and Alibaba, using TerraUSD. Bitcoin and Tether will soon be accepted for the purchase of synthetic assets as well. Users of Mirror Wallet can purchase fractional shares, which, given the expense of top-trading stocks, further increases accessibility.\n\nMirror Wallet is built on Mirror Protocol ( https://mirror.finance ), the first synthetic assets protocol that tracks the price of stocks, futures, exchange-traded funds, and other traditional financial assets. By enabling the minting of synthetic assets — Mirrored Assets (mAssets) that \"mirror\" the price behavior of real-world assets by reflecting the exchange prices on-chain — Mirror Protocol democratizes access to US equities and other assets that have been historically difficult to approach for anyone based outside of the United States.\n\nNew assets beyond the initial 12 synthetics tracking the most popular US technology stocks can be introduced by anyone holding MIR tokens — the governance token of the Mirror Protocol. The proposal would be put to a vote, and if the Decentralized Autonomous Organization responsible for Mirror's governance passes the proposal, the new asset would be added.\n",
  "Missing Parameter or Precondition Checks": "One of the simplest programming mistakes that we encounter is either not validating the arguments of a function or forgetting essential checks for an operation to be valid. Often, this includes address parameters not being checked for the zero address or, for example, not verifying that a user has sufficient token balance to execute a certain operation. Another good example is access control, where only a certain type of user should be authorized to call a function but this check is never performed. These errors are usually the result of a sloppy design process. It is a good idea to have a written specification of all functions, stating the parameters, pre-conditions, and operations to be performed. Sticking to best practice design patterns, such as Checks Effects Interactions, can also help to prevent this type of vulnerability.\n",
  "Mist": "A blockchain-based action RPG game centered around NFTs, Staking, and Farming. Built with Unity using the in-house Mist NFT Game Framework (MNGF), the project offers players an immersive in-game environment with five playable character classes and countless spells, abilities, and environments.\n\nIn-game NFTs are obtained via rare monster drops and in-game events. The NFTs in Mist are not like the typical \"collectible card\" NFTs so common in crypto today. Instead, they are usable and functional NFTs that can be inserted into the Mist Game Framework and become special in-game items.\n\nThese NFTs can be bought or sold both in the in-game exchanges (auction houses) or in 3rd party NFT exchanges outside the game world.\n\nPlayers can stake the in-game currency (the MIST native token) by purchasing or investing in in-game businesses, such as taverns, general stores, and more. By \"staking\" this way, players earn rewards as in-game businesses generate revenue.\n\nPlayers can also farm by \"purchasing\" farmland, farms, or livestock. As your farms work, you receive rewards.\n\nAll of these elements are built and run on the Binance Smart Chain. Each function is intertwined with the blockchain, and the MIST in-game currency is creatively used for these functions.\n",
  "MIST Token": "Native token of Mist. It will be used to purchase and swap for NFTs in-game and outside the game world. They foresee this being one of the main uses of the token. The in-game auction houses will allow players to list their NFTs for sale and swap them for the MIST native token.\n\nAdditionally, the MIST token can be staked and used for farming outside the game universe. When users stake or use the token to farm, they will receive rewards.\n\nThe MIST token is connected to and synchronized with the Binance Smart Chain. As such, it can be easily, quickly, and cheaply sent from one wallet to another on the network. It can also be sent into and out of the Mist universe.\n\nThe primary use of the tokens is as the native in-game currency of the Mist universe. The currency is used to purchase items in-game, swap for NFTs, repair damaged items, purchase mounts, and more.\n",
  "Mithraeum": "A sandbox for governance, with a virtual world serving as the testbed for its primary mechanic – smart policy. It’s a strategy game defined by conquest, trade, construction, and industrial innovation, but the real innovation is how it’s managed. Mithraeum incentivizes cooperation to produce value-generating assets, which must be nurtured and protected against marauders. This incentivizes users to find the best way to cooperate to gain more value and resources according to game theory. The action may unfold in a virtual world, but the applications for the smart policy that powers Mithraeum are far greater. Compatible with an array of Ethereum-based DeFi protocols and dApps, Mithraeum’s applications are manifold. From on-chain community management to real world finance, Mithraeum pioneers a more efficient way to work. Just as the best way to play Mithraeum is through cooperation, the best way to win at life is through collaboration.\n",
  "Mixicles": "Privacy-preserving decentralized finance (DeFi) instruments. Mixicles ingest input payments from two or more parties and yield payouts that are conditioned on oracle reports. They are designed to provide privacy for both the terms and outcomes of the financial instruments they execute. At the same time, Mixicles can support rigorous regulatory and auditing requirements. The most appealing feature of Mixicles is their avoidance of expensive cryptography and complicated contract structures. Mixicles are conceptually simple, and have low on-chain and off-chain resource consumption.\n",
  "Mixing Service": "Also known as a tumbler, it is a service to improve the privacy and anonymity of cryptocurrency transactions by mixing potentially identifiable or “tainted” cryptocurrencies with other unrelated transactions, making it harder to track what the cryptocurrency was used for and who it belongs to.\n",
  "MKR Token": "An ERC-20 token that is native to the Maker Protocol. MKR is the governance token and recapitalization source of the Maker Protocol. As a governance token, MKR is used by its holders to vote on a number of different things. Voting is used to execute changes to parameters inside of the Maker Protocol like Stability Fees, the DSR, Debt Ceilings, and many others. Voting is also used to make decisions on the non-technical aspects of the protocol like asset priority lists, governance processes, role mandates, and even electing individuals to fill specific roles. The token also acts as a source of recapitalization when the Maker Protocol runs at a deficit. The possibility of MKR token supply Dilution gives holders a strong incentive to govern the system well. Inversely, the destruction of MKR through the auctioning of Dai from the system's excess surplus further incentivizes holders to govern the system well.\n",
  "MLN Token": "The token is used as “asset management gas”. The asset management gas is collected on three functions in the Melon protocol: setting-up a fund; investing in a fund and; claiming any fees (rewards). Notably, the protocol does not charge fees on trading or redemptions in order to keep barriers to entry low. The asset management gas paid on a specific function is calculated by using the number of Ethereum gas units consumed in that function multiplied by the asset management gas price. The fees are collected in ETH and transferred to the Melon Engine Smart-Contract which then purchases MLN tokens at a premium and burns them. Crucially, this buy and burn model directly links the usage of the network to the value of the token.\n",
  "Mnemonic Phrase": "A list of words used in sequence to access or restore your cryptocurrency assets. It should be kept secret from everyone else. It is a standard in most HD wallets. Also known as mnemonic seed or seed phrase.\n",

  "Model": "A graphical, mathematical (symbolic), physical, verbal representation, or otherwise simplified version of a concept, phenomenon, relationship, structure, system, or aspect of the real world. The objectives of a model include: (1) Facilitating understanding by eliminating unnecessary components; (2) Aiding decision making by simulating ‘what if’ scenarios; and (3) Explain, controlling, and predicting events on the basis of past observations. Since most interesting objects and phenomena are both too complicated (they have numerous parts) and too complex (those parts are densely interconnected) to be understood in their entirety, a model contains only those features that are of primary importance to the model maker’s purpose.\n",

Moet features blazing low fees, near-instant settlement, fair volatility pricing and deep liquidity with a hybrid limit orderbook and virtual AMM model.\n",
  "Moloch": "The story of Moloch was memed into the Ethereum narrative by Ameen Soleimani, creator of MolochDAO, during the 2018-19 bear market. Moloch is the god of human coordination failure, and the post Meditations on Moloch from the Slate Star Codex blog was the topic of conversation for weeks, if not months, during the long brutal bear market. While things were boring and slow, the story of Moloch and how Ethereum fits into the story was a fun mental exercise and community conversation.\n\nThe Moloch blog post goes through a few thought experiments that illustrate the power of Moloch…the answer to the question “why can't we have nice things”… why countries can’t coordinate to solve climate change, or why we can’t save the oceans or forests, or Great Barrier Reef.\n\nIn short, Moloch is represented by the extremely unfortunate reality that, the more humans successfully coordinate with each other, the stronger the incentive there is to defect and become a profit-maximalist.\n\nWe are all slaves to Moloch. His evil flows in our blood; his vices are our DNA. We are all rationally incentivized actors, and therefore ultimately we must follow his lead.\n",
  "MolochDAO": "A community DAO focused on funding Ethereum development projects. MolochDAO incentivizes coordination by collapsing traditionally separate parts of a company into one process, and by creating additional incentives for defectors to defect and exit. The latter is meaningful since it keeps the core owners more gainfully committed.\n",
  "Monetary Velocity": "A measurement of the rate at which money is exchanged in an economy. It is the number of times that money moves from one entity to another. It also refers to how much a unit of currency is used in a given period of time. Simply put, it's the rate at which consumers and businesses in an economy collectively spend money. The velocity of money is usually measured as a ratio of gross domestic product (GDP) to a country's M1 or M2 money supply.\n",

Monetha's products include identity management, P2P deals, data exchange, and a commerce suite. They also offer blockchain consulting and custom development services.\n",
  "Money Lego": "The core philosophy of the DeFi space is to build for interoperability. This allows the ecosystem to benefit from individual progress, pushing decentralized finance continually forward.\n\nThis ideology is reminiscent of everyone's favorite toy, Lego. As people visit a large bin of random legos, pieces get combined together in new and creative ways. Then when new people dive into the Lego bin, they find preassembled combinations of Legos that they too start building with, creating bigger and better things. This eventually snowballs into a whole universe of exciting Lego creations.\n\nIn DeFi, projects are designed to not only be used as a stand-alone product but also easily integrated into products that can benefit from their functionality. Thus, this ecosystem will eventually snowball into an exciting universe of decentralized financial products.\n",
  "Money Market": "A term that refers to trading in very short-term debt investments. At the wholesale level, it involves large-volume trades of very short-term debt products, such as overnight reserves or commercial paper, between institutions and traders.

  "Monthly Active Users ": "A key performance indicator (KPI) used by social networking and other companies to count the number of unique users who visit a site within the past month. Websites generally recognize monthly active users via an identification number, email address, or username.\n\nMonthly Active Users (MAU) helps to measure an online business's general health and is the basis for calculating other website metrics. MAU is also useful when assessing the efficacy of a business's marketing campaigns and gauging both present and potential customers' experience. Investors in the social media industry, pay attention when companies report MAU, as it is a KPI that can affect a social-media company's stock price.\n",
  "Moon": "A term that is often employed to describe a cryptocurrency that is under a strong upward market trend.\n",
  "Moonbeam": "A developer-oriented blockchain that strives to provide compatibility with the existing Ethereum developer toolchain and network. It does this by providing a full EVM implementation, a Web3-compatible API, and bridges that connect Moonbeam to existing Ethereum networks. This allows developers to deploy existing Solidity smart contracts and DApp frontends to Moonbeam with minimal changes. Moonbeam will also be a parachain on the Polkadot network. That means that it will get shared security from the Polkadot relay chain and will be able to integrate with other chains that are connected to Polkadot (once that functionality is available on Polkadot). It facilitates multi-chain development as minimal configuration changes are needed, familiar smart contract languages are used, and has pre-built integrations.\n",
  "MoonCat​Rescue": "Mooncats are procedurally generated pixel cats which are deterministically generated based on blockchain data. This project is an exploration of the ability to release tradable collectibles and record their ownership on the Ethereum blockchain. This feature of blockchain technology has been demonstrated by projects such as CryptoPunks. The team has expanded on the idea and added a few novel, and what we think are exciting, features: (1) Mining off the chain, (2) Procedural generation, and (3) Irrevocable Naming.\n",
  "Mooniswap": "Next generation AMM protocol by 1inch. All AMMs with constant product pricing functions offer worse slippage as the trade size increases. Mooniswap fixes this issue by creating an asymmetry between the two trading directions. Rather than moving both the buy-sell prices simultaneously and offering an immediate arbitrage opportunity, Mooniswap gradually increases the price of the opposite trade. Consequently, the size of the arbitrage opportunity in the opposite direction also increases gradually. This allows the pool to capture some portion of the slippage via further organic trading, rather than giving it all away to the fastest arbitrageur. To achieve that behavior, we have introduced virtual balances that emulate different prices for different swap directions. With virtual balances, purchase of asset A leads the curves for purchasing asset A and asset B to temporarily diverge. The curves eventually converge again over some predetermined time decay. Mooniswap initially utilizes 0.3% swap fee which can be lowered all the way down to 0% in the future as a way to provide more competitive prices to the market. Mooniswap also introduces an abstraction layer on top of native ETH asset and ERC20 standard to allow direct usage of native ETH. This abstraction avoids wrapping and unwraping WETH token therefore significantly lowering gas usage on pools with native ETH.\n",
  "MoonPay": "Mobile app that makes it easier for users to buy cryptocurrencies instantly. It is designed for humans; Our mobile-first approach ensures a smooth integration with web or native applications. MoonPay supports all major debit/credit cards, bank transfers and new mobile payment methods such as Apple Pay, Google Pay and Samsung Pay. We use best-in-class tools and practices to uphold the highest level of security for our users.\n",
  "Moonriver": "A Community-Led Sister Parachain on Kusama. Moonriver is a companion network to Moonbeam and provides a permanently incentivized canary network. New code ships to Moonriver first, where it can be tested and verified under real economic conditions. Once proven, the same code ships to Moonbeam on Polkadot. Developers can quickly deploy their new or existing Solidity DApps to the Moonriver parachain — with little or no modifications — and gain easy access to the Kusama network.\n\nLike Moonbeam, Moonriver is a full Ethereum-like environment and works with industry-standard Ethereum tools, DApps, and protocols. By mirroring Ethereum's Web3 RPC, accounts, keys, subscriptions, logs, and more, Moonriver minimizes the changes required to run existing Solidity smart contracts on the network. Ethereum projects can simply replicate their DApp and deploy it to Moonbeam using Hardhat, Truffle, Remix, and other popular deployment tools.\n",
  "Moonwolf": "A DeFi ecosystem on Polygon. $WOLF is the first deflationary token on the Polygon network. Total supply is reduced and redistributed with every transaction.\n",
  "Moore's Law": "The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit (IC) doubles about every two years. Moore's law is an observation and projection of a historical trend. Rather than a law of physics, it is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production. Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development, thus functioning a bit like a self-fulfilling prophecy. Advancements in digital electronics, such as the reduction in quality-adjusted microprocessor prices, the increase in memory capacity (RAM and flash), the improvement of sensors, and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras, are strongly linked to Moore's law. These step changes in digital electronics have been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth. Industry experts have not reached a consensus on exactly when Moore's law will cease to apply. Microprocessor architects report that semiconductor advancement has slowed industry-wide since around 2010, below the pace predicted by Moore's law. However, as of 2018, leading semiconductor manufacturers have developed IC fabrication processes in mass production which are claimed to keep pace with Moore's law.\n",

  "Moving Average Convergence Divergence": "A trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a security's price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD called the \"signal line,\" is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line. Moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.\n",
  "MOVR Token": "The Utility Token of the Moonriver Network. As a decentralized smart contract platform, Moonriver requires the MOVR token to function.\n\nSome of the uses of the MOVR token on Moonriver include:\n\n Supporting the gas metering of smart contract execution\n Incentivizing collators and powering the mechanics around the creation of a decentralized node infrastructure on which the platform can run\n Facilitating the on-chain governance mechanism including proposing referenda, electing council members, voting, etc\n Paying for transaction fees on the network\n",

  "mStable": "A provider of autonomous and non-custodial stablecoin infrastructure. Stablecoin users face the issue of fragmentation in same-peg assets, a lack of native yield, and a lack of protection against permanent capital loss. mStable products (MINT, SWAP, SAVE, and EARN) are built specifically to address these pain-points. mStable provides mAssets which represent some underlying value peg and are minted/redeemed on-chain via smart contracts. mAssets are backed 1:1 by a basket of existing tokenised same-base assets (hereafter bAssets). Each mAsset is a liquidity share for its asset pool as well as a medium of exchange, unit of account and store of value in its own right. Each mAsset has an outsized native interest rate that is derived from lending bAssets on third party lending protocols, fees collected from mStable's SWAP product, and other sources of income. Users can swap between bAssets with zero price slippage, regardless of order size. For example, in mUSD, uses are able to swap 1 DAI for 1 USDC at no cost, except gas and a small fee. \n",
  "mStable USD": "The first asset on the mStable protocol. To mint an mStable asset you send any of the underlying assets to the smart contract of that asset. For the USD asset, the underlying stablecoins could be USDC, TUSD, USDT, USDC, GUSD, DAI, and so on. For example, if you send 100 DAI to the mUSD contract, you will receive 100 redeemable mUSD back. Minting costs you nothing — in fact you will be rewarded for doing this. Your mUSD is, in theory, more secure than your DAI as it’s backed by several other stablecoins as well as, eventually, by the mStable system token Meta.\n",

  "Net Realized Profit/Loss": "When coins are moved, their value is \"realized\" relative to their value when they were last moved. Net Realized Profit/Loss denotes the net profit or loss (USD value) of all moved coins relative to the last time they were moved. As such, it shows whether investors are selling at a profit or loss. Realized Profit/Loss can be read as the profit and loss components that contribute to Spent Output Profit Ratio. Net Realized Profit/Loss is calculated by subtracting Realized Loss from Realized Profit. Introduced by Glassnode in June 2020.\n",
  "Net Unrealized Profit/Loss": "Metric that looks at the difference between Unrealized Profit and Unrealized Loss to determine whether the network as a whole is currently in a state of profit or loss. By looking at the delta between the price when a UTXO was created vs. the current price of an asset, it can be determined whether the specific coins in that UTXO are in a state of unrealized profit (price has increased) or loss (price has decreased). When looking at this across the entire network, it is possible to see how much of the network is in profit, and how much is in loss. Any value above zero indicates that the network is in a state of net profit, while values below zero indicate a state of net loss. In general, the further NUPL deviates from zero, the closer the market trends towards tops and bottoms. As such, NUPL can help investors identify when to take profit (blue) and when to re-enter (red). Created by Tuur Demeester, Tamás Blummer, and Michiel Lescrauwaet on February 2019.\n",

This is not the same as rETH which represents tokenised staking deposits + rewards earned by the whole network and is not 1:1. When smart contracts are natively enabled on ETH2, a smart contract will be deployed that will allow users with the nETH token to burn it for ETH. This is expected to occur during Phase 2 on the ETH2 roll out map.\n",

  "Network Value to Transaction Ratio": "Ratio that describes the relationship between market cap and transfer volumes. It is considered analogous to the PE (price to earnings) Ratio used in equity markets.\n\nWhen Network Value to Transaction (NVT) is high, this indicates that the network value is outpacing the value being transferred on the network. This could represent legitimate growth stages, or a potential price bubble. Conversely, when NVT is low, this means that network value isn't keeping up with increased usage of the network, potentially representing bearish sentiment. \n\nNVT is calculated by dividing market cap (in USD) by daily transfer volume (in USD). \n\nCreated by Willy Woo in February 2017.\n",
  "Network Value to Transaction Signal": "A modified version of the original Network Value to Transaction (NVT) Ratio. It uses a 90 day moving average of the daily transaction volume in the denominator instead of the raw daily transaction volume.

  "Neufund": "Fintech startup with a mission to open the world of finance: create new markets and bring together assets, investors, and entrepreneurs. Products include a mobile application that allows users to tokenize assets on-the-go. \n",
  "Neutrino Protocol": "An algorithmic price-stable cryptocurrency protocol that allows for the creation of stable coins tied to a specific real world asset, such as national currency or commodity, collateralized by WAVES token. There can be different variations of Neutrino-based stablecoins, depending on which external asset it is pegged to: USD-Neutrino (USDN), EUR-Neutrino, BTC-Neutrino, S&P 500-Neutrino, and so on. The exchange rate of the stablecoin to the reserve token is determined by a set of external oracles. In some cases, the full redemption of the stablecoin may become impossible due to volatility of the crypto market, or the diminishing value of the underlying asset during a bearish trend. To counter this, a new token instrument can be added, which ensures that in case of diminishing reserves in underlying assets, there is an incentive to replenish those reserves through the purchase of a so-called Neutrino system base token (NSBT). The swapping of Neutrino tokens is administered via the smart contract. In addition, other liquidity applications of Neutrino base tokens can be implemented. Neutrino Protocol can provide a deflationary mechanism for DeFi-oriented blockchain platforms such as Ethereum, EOS, Cosmos, or Waves.\n",
  "Neutrino System Base Token": "A utility token for the Neutrino system that is designed to ensure the stability of reserves on the Neutrino smart contract through the so-called mechanism of reserve recapitalization. NSBT allows users to speculate on the so-called BR parameter, or Backing Ratio: the proportion of reserves in relation to the supply of Neutrino. As a result of successful speculation, traders have a chance to generate profit in USDN. In addition to being the driver of recapitalization, base tokens can be used as payment for protocol operations: creating a collateral position (generating USDN against WAVES) and paying fees to form \"hedge funds\" for generating new types of synthetic assets, such as GLDN (Gold Neutrino), EURN (Euro Neutrino) etc.\n",
  "Neutrino USD": "An algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar and collateralized by the WAVES token. All operations involving USDN, such as issuance, staking and reward payouts, are fully transparent and governed by a smart contract. Any deviations from the 1:1 ratio can be counteracted by arbitration bots, given that every USDN token is backed by WAVES. USDN's sustainability is ensured with Neutrino Token (NSBT) through issuing, trading and liquidation mechanics. When the value of WAVES against USD rises, a reserve fund is formed to provide backing in case WAVES' price drops. When the reserve fund is not sufficient to compensate for a decline in value, the smart contract issues and sells NSBT with a discount, enabling users to collect a profit by selling the token in the future.\n",

The team is aware of and dislike how some groups have intertwined negativity with its symbol, so they are here to reclaim the humor of the meme through our shared love for NFTs and having some fun. If their pepes are used for racism, bigotry, or anything terrible… they will shame you and Kek will have vengeance on your soul. And you will never get a girlfriend.\n",
  "Non-compounding Fees": "For the previous Uniswap v1 and v2 versions, swap commissions, or the fees that liquidity providers receive when trades complete successfully, were directly deposited as liquidity in the pool. This automatic deposit of fees into the liquidity pool allowed the pool to grow consistently over time. This was known as compounding fee growth.\n\nIn Uniswap v3, fees no longer compound into the pool’s reserves. Instead, we have non-compounding fees. Non-Compounding fees means that fee earnings are now stored separately in a new smart contract called the Periphery Contract. This new smart contract keeps track of all the fees that collect from each of the exchange transactions that successfully complete in the Uniswap pool.\n",
  "Non-Custodial Wallet": "Cryptocurrency wallets that give users complete control of their keys and therefore their funds. Such wallets eliminate a third-party between the user and their cryptocurrencies. Non-Custodial Wallets can be browser-based, come in the form of software installed on mobile devices or on desktops, or a hardware device, among other options.\n\nWhile Non-Custodial Wallets do not require users to trust a third party, they require them to trust themselves to keep their keys and their wallet secure. If users were to lose their wallet, destroy their wallet, or forget their password, and they haven't taken precautions to be able to regenerate their wallet, they could lose access to their funds. Any Non-Custodial Wallet with significant funds should be password protected, and that password should be kept in written form in a location only that the user knows. In addition, users should not allow anyone physical access to their non-custodial crypto wallet. Were someone to discover the PIN or password, they could drain the user's funds without their knowledge. \n",
  "Non-Fungible Liquidity": "Non-Fungible Liquidity is a feature where the funds of liquidity providers that are placed into the pool are represented by a special Ethereum account type known by the term Non-Fungible Token. The Non-Fungible token is a design guide also known as the ERC721 specification. The specification describes a token that has an owner, a supply, a balance, but each token is unique and non-divisible.\n\nIn Uniswap v3, Liquidity Pool ownership is represented by Non-Fungible tokens. These tokens are different to the v1 Liquidity Provider tokens that were previously based on the ERC-20 specification and were previously fungible and divisible. Fees that liquidity providers receive when traders are completed on Uniswap are accounted for by the Non-Fungible Liquidity tokens.\n\nNon-Fungible Liquidity tokens are also known as Native Liquidity tokens in Uniswap v3\n",
  "Non-fungible Token": "Cryptographic assets on blockchain with unique identification codes and metadata that distinguish them from each other. Unlike cryptocurrencies, they cannot be traded or exchanged at equivalency. This differs from fungible tokens like cryptocurrencies, which are identical to each other and, therefore, can be used as a medium for commercial transactions.\n\nThe distinct construction of each Non-Fungible Token (NFT) has the potential for several use cases. For example, they are an ideal vehicle to digitally represent physical assets like real estate and artwork. Because they are based on blockchains, NFTs can also be used to remove intermediaries and connect artists with audiences or for identity management. NFTs can remove intermediaries, simplify transactions, and create new markets.\n\nNFTs evolved from the ERC-721 standard. Developed by some of the same people responsible for the ERC-20 smart contract, ERC-721 defines the minimum interface – ownership details, security, and metadata – required for exchange and distribution of gaming tokens. The ERC-1155 standard takes the concept further by reducing the transaction and storage costs required for NFTs and batching multiple types of non-fungible tokens into a single contract.\n\nPerhaps the most famous use case for NFTs is that of cryptokitties. Launched in November 2017, cryptokitties are digital representations of cats with unique identifications on Ethereum’s blockchain. Each kitty is unique and has a price in ether. They reproduce among themselves and produce new offspring, which have different attributes and valuations as compared to their parents. Within a few short weeks of being launched, cryptokitties racked up a fan base that spent $20 million worth of ether purchasing, feeding, and nurturing them. Some enthusiasts even spent upwards of $100,000 on the effort.\n\nWhile the cryptokitties use case may sound trivial, succeeding ones have more serious business implications. For example, NFTs have been used in private equity transactions as well as real estate deals. One of the implications of enabling multiple types of tokens in a contract is the ability to provide escrow for different types of NFTs, from artwork to real estate, into a single financial transaction.    \n",
  "Nonce": "Stands for \"Number only once\".  It is a one-time use identifier selected in a random or pseudo-random manner to securely transmit data, preventing replay attacks. In the case of Ethereum wallets, they are assigned sequentially from 0, and track the number and order of transactions sent from a given address.\n",
  "NonFungible.com": "Website that provides consistent and usable experience for digital asset (NFT) markets, valuations, and up to date news and reviews of various projects. The creation of non-fungible tokens using blockchain technology allowed the emergence of new markets for provable ownership of digital assets. These markets, like the cryptocurrency markets, are highly speculative. However, there was no tool to monitor the evolution or trends of these markets. Users, buyers, and players had no way to know the estimate “blue book” value of an asset or whether there was adequate liquidity to realize their earning potential. Their website's goals are to enhance the liquidity, and ultimately, adoption of non-fungible tokens; provide transparency to the non-fungible token market; build asset valuation models to estimate \"blue book\" value of different digital assets (NFT); and help projects understand their customers or marketing opportunities through the production of tailored market reports, analysis, and competitor research.\n",

  "Nsure Network": "A platform for users to trade risks. They borrowed the operation model of Lloyd's the London while designing the structure, because they aim to build a marketplace for users trading insurance risk comparable to Lloyd's. With Nsure, information is transparent, and users are allowed not only to be outsourcing risk, but also becoming risk-takers, capital providers, governance actors and auditors of the system.\n\nThe challenge of forming an effective and efficient insurance solution against hacks to smart contracts is attributed to the difficulties in 1) modelling the expected losses, 2) handling claims of varied type of hacks, and 3) collecting adequate capital to support the underwriting while maintaining an attractive return to the capital providers. Nsure forms its solution by working out the design of capital model, dynamic pricing model, claim adjustment process, and rating system.\n",

Unlike any other marketplace, the use of ODE allows ODEM to reduce fees, increase efficiency and improve security in a transparent, global exchange. Students place a stake (small deposit) of ODE into a smart contract to reserve their place on a course. Educators also place a stake of ODE to teach their educational programs. The process of staking allows ODEM and the educator to assess the levels of student interest in a particular topic before actually creating the program. If a participant backs out, their stake is forfeited. Every time a student is issued a digital credential on ODEM, a transaction is registered on the Ethereum blockchain, requiring ODE.

  "Off-Chain Reporting": "Off-Chain Reporting (OCR) is the third and latest version of the Chainlink Core software client run by Chainlink nodes, which significantly improves the efficiency of how data is aggregated by Chainlink oracles. OCR reduces operating costs by up to 90% and enables the Chainlink Network to generate a 10x increase in the amount of secure, real-world data available to smart contract applications. \n\nOCR allows Chainlink nodes to communicate off-chain and aggregate data at zero gas costs using a distributed, peer-to-peer network. In OCR's computation model, each node fetches data from one or multiple data sources, signs it with their unique private key, and broadcasts it to the rest of the oracle network off-chain. Once a sufficient number of responses have been generated, a single transaction is transmitted on-chain containing every node's observation. The oracle report and node signatures are then validated on-chain by a smart contract, providing the transparency and end-to-end security guarantees that are fundamental to Chainlink oracle networks. \n\nAll Chainlink nodes operating in-production run the OCR and FluxMonitor clients in parallel to achieve multi-client diversity and security through redundancy. For a deeper dive into OCR's design goals and report generation process, read the OCR protocol paper.\n",

  "Optimistic Rollups": "A type of layer 2 constructions that do not run on Ethereum's base layer but on top of it. This enables running smart contracts at scale while still being secured by Ethereum. These constructions resemble Plasma, but trade the almost infinite scalability of Plasma to run an EVM compatible Virtual Machine called OVM (Optimistic Virtual Machine) which enables Optimistic Rollups (ORs) to run anything Ethereum can.\n\nThe name Optimistic Rollups originates from how the solution works. 'Optimistic' is used because aggregators publish only the bare minimum information needed with no proofs, assuming the aggregators run without commiting frauds, and only providing proofs in case of fraud. 'Rollups' is used because transactions are commited to main chain in bundles (that is, they are rolled-up).\n\nAny user that uses a Dapp that is deployed to a layer 2 with an Optimistic Rollup construction can enjoy economic abstraction (eg: fee-free transactions, paying with ERC-20, etc.) and quasi-instant transactions (transactions in the ball-park of 200ms).\n",
  "Optimistic Virtual Machine": "An optimistic implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Each computational step is called a transition. These transitions can be evaluated client-side by individual users wishing to compute or verify the latest state, or on-chain in a contract to verify fraud proofs. This can be thought of as a containerized L2-compatible EVM inside of the EVM and is similar to how Docker works on the computer. In order to build this OVM virtual environment, the team took advantage of the Turing completeness of the EVM to embed EVM sandbox functionality directly inside of it, with a virtual addressing layer and virtualized storage.\n\nThe Optimistic Virtual Machine (OVM) supports all existing Ethereum dev tools and libraries including Solidity, Vyper, Truffle, Open Zeppelin, Metamask, and Web3.js just to name a few.\n",
  "Options": "Financial instruments that are derivatives based on the value of underlying securities such as stocks.

Opyn's smart contracts have been audited by OpenZeppelin.‌\n",
  "Oracle": "Smart contracts on Ethereum are fully self-contained and any information or access to off-chain data is restricted. This is required for security reasons as execution in blockchains must be deterministic and the response to subsequent calls to outside API's could change in unknown ways. Nevertheless, certain desirable types of smart contracts are only possible with additional outside data.\n\nAn Oracle is a conceptual solution which takes real-world off-chain data and submits an immutable copy of this information into blocks – thereby making it available for future smart contract use.\n",
  "Orbit": "A multi-asset blockchain that stores, transfers and verifies information and assets which exist on various public blockchains through decentralized Inter- Blockchain Communication (IBC). One of the biggest benefits of utilizing IBC of Orbit Chain is that it to allows isolated public chains to connect to each other's public blockchain.

OrbitDB provides various types of databases for different data models and use cases: (1) log: an immutable (append-only) log with traversable history. Useful for “latest N” use cases or as a message queue; (2) feed: a mutable log with traversable history. Entries can be added and removed. Useful for “shopping cart” type of use cases, or for example as a feed of blog posts or “tweets”; (3) keyvalue: a key-value database just like your favourite key-value database; (4) docs: a document database to which JSON documents can be stored and indexed by a specified key. Useful for building search indices or version controlling documents and data; and (5) counter: Useful for counting events separate from log/feed data. All databases are implemented on top of ipfs-log, an immutable, operation-based conflict-free replicated data structure (CRDT) for distributed systems. If none of the OrbitDB database types match your needs and/or you need case-specific functionality, you can easily implement and use a custom database store of your own.\n",

  "Our Network": "Newsletter that aims to deliver compelling data-driven insights from a wide range of networks and also educate readers about on-chain metrics.\n",
  "Out of The Money": "An Out of The Money (OTM) option requires a very large rise in the price of the cryptocurrency to be profitable. If a large enough move in the underlying cryptocurrency occurs, an OTM call can deliver a much higher percentage profit than an ITM or ATM call. If the cryptocurrency price falls dramatically, the loss on the OTM call will be smaller than on an ATM or ITM call. However, a big move in the cryptocurrency price is less likely than a smaller move, and OTM options will expire worthless if the move in the cryptocurrency isn't big enough. An example of an OTM CALL option would be where you buy a WBTC $50,000 strike price CALL option, and the current market price for WBTC is $40,000. An example of an OTM PUT option would be where you buy a WBTC $50,000 strike price PUT option, and the current market price for WBTC is $70,000.\n",
  "Outcome Bias": "A bias that arises when a decision is based on the outcome of previous events, without regard to how the past events developed. Outcome bias does not involve analysis of factors that lead to a previous event, and instead de-emphasizes the events preceding the outcomes and overemphasizes the outcome. Unlike hindsight bias, outcome bias does not involve the distortion of past events.\n",
  "Outdated Compiler Version": "Using an outdated compiler version can be problematic especially if there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current compiler version. It is recommended to use a recent version of the Solidity compiler.\n",
  "Over the Counter ": "Securities that are traded over-the-counter are traded via a broker-dealer network as opposed to on a centralized exchange.\n",
  "Overbought": "A term used when a security is believed to be trading at a level above its intrinsic or fair value. Overbought generally describes recent or short-term movement in the price of the security, and reflects an expectation that the market will correct the price in the near future. This belief is often the result of technical analysis of the security’s price history, but fundamentals may also be employed. A stock that is overbought may be a good candidate for sale. The opposite of overbought is oversold, where a security is thought to be trading below its intrinsic value.\n",
  "Overlay Protocol": "A cryptocurrency that allows users to place bets on nearly any streaming data. It recreates the dynamics of trading, but without counterparties. Thus it completely solves the liquidity problems which beset similar systems like cash-settled futures, exchange and over-thecounter trading, and scalar prediction markets. The idea behind Overlay is very simple. Using an oracle, any OVL holder can query a set of streaming data sources, such as the number of observed butterflies in the UK last year, the number of albums sold by an artist last month, the tons of steel exported from Australia yesterday, and so forth. Each distinct data stream is, for the OVL token, a market. Any fraction of an OVL token can be locked to a single market price by opening a virtual trade, which is a buy or a sell of a market at whatever value the oracle yields for the data stream. At a later time, the owner of those OVL can unlock them. The value of the data stream will be queried again, the difference in value between unlocking and locking time will be computed as a percentage return, and the original amount of locked OVL in the owner's wallet will be increased or decreased by that percentage.\n\n",
  "Overline": "An interoperability protocol that can connect all blockchains--including Bitcoin--to DeFi allowing users to move and trade freely.

To achieve interoperability Overline utilizes a unique proprietary consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Distance which builds upon Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work.\n",
  "Oversold": "The term oversold refers to a condition where an asset has traded lower in price and has the potential for a price bounce. An oversold condition can last for a long time, and therefore being oversold doesn't mean a price rally will come soon, or at all. Many technical indicators identify oversold and overbought levels. These indicators base their assessment on where the price is currently trading relative to prior prices. Fundamentals can also be used to assess whether an asset is potentially oversold and has deviated from its typical value metrics.\n",
  "OVL Token": "Native token of Overlay Protocol. The Overlay mechanism is simple: traders enter positions by locking up OVL tokens in long or short positions on various data streams offered by the protocol. Data streams are obtained via manipulation-resistant oracles. When a trader exits that same position later, the protocol dynamically mints/burns OVL based on their net profit/loss for the trade to compensate them. This is reflected in the total existing supply of OVL.\n",
  "OVR": "A World Scale, open-source, AR platform powered by Ethereum Blockchain. OVR makes it possible for users provided with a mobile device or smart glasses to live interactive augmented reality experiences customised in the real world.

The hexagons are called OVRLands, have specific geographic positions and a standard dimension of 300 Square Meters. The total number of OVRLands is 1.660.954.464.112. OVRLands can be further divided in 7 hexagons allowing for even more precise localisations. OVRlands are not only a reference system used to position AR and VR content, they are also the fundamental digital asset that will enable the OVR community to generate the economic incentives for development and growth. OVRLands will be bought by OVROwners, their property will be granted by a non-fungible token – ERC-721 standard – recorded on the Ethereum blockchain allowing for decentralised and censorship resistant property rights. Property of OVRLands will ground the economic incentives to generate, distribute\nand curate high quality AR and VR content. OVRLand is a scarce and unique resource, only the private keys of the Ethereum address owning the OVRLand NFT can control it. In the case of private keys loss, the control on OVRLand would be lost forever. In order to prevent this eventuality, the team requirse the owner of the OVRLand to prove the control of the private keys by performing any kind of action on the blockchain (could be a simple ping function) at least once every 3 years. In the case OVROwner is not capable to provide such prove of private key ownership in 3 years the OVRLand will be made available again for public sale.\n",

The team aims to give holders of yield-generating assets the opportunity to generate additional yield and to lock in future yield upfront, while offering traders direct exposure to future yield streams, without the need for an underlying collateral. Pendle exists on top of first-degree protocols. They currently support Aave and Compound, with more platforms to be integrated in future.\n\nThere are three components that make up Pendle’s system:\n Yield tokenization\n Pendle’s Automated Market Maker (AMM)\n Governance (Coming soon)\n\nHolders of yield-generating assets deposit their yield-bearing tokens into Pendle in order to mint an Ownership Token (OT) and a Future-Yield Token (XYT). Users can then utilize their XYT in two different ways. Firstly, they can deposit their XYT into Pendle’s AMMs to provide liquidity to Pendle. In return, fees and other incentives are given to these liquidity providers (LP). Secondly, they can sell their XYT for cash upfront, allowing them to fix the interest rates and lock in their returns immediately. Traders will be able to buy these XYTs directly, without the need to lock up their underlying assets. This is a more capital-efficient way for them to gain exposure to future yield.\n",
  "Pendle Automated Market Maker": "The Pendle AMM aims to minimize time-dependent impermanent loss that arises from the provision of liquidity using tokens with time decay. The Pendle curve shifting algorithm closely resembles the concept of option pricing models, where price decays more drastically towards the end of the contract than at the beginning.\n\nThere will be a default 0.35% liquidity provider fee for all trades against liquidity pools on the Pendle's AMM. This fee will be adjustable via governance proposals and voting once it goes live. The Pendle AMM is designed to support a protocol-level exit fee to be used to support continual work on the Pendle platform. However, it is currently being set to 0% and will be changeable via governance proposals if deemed necessary.\n",
  "Percent Supply in Profit": "A coin is in profit if the current price is higher than the price at the time it was last moved. Conversely, a coin is in loss if the current price is lower than the price at the time it was last moved. Percent Supply in Profit highlights the percentage of the total supply which is currently in profit. This metric represents an oscillator that allows us to better understand the current state of the market for a given coin: in general, values above 95% suggest market tops, while values below 5% signal bottoms.\n\nPercent Supply in Profit is calculated by dividing the absolute Supply in Profit by the total circulating supply and converting to a percentage.\n\nIntroduced by Glassnode in November 2019.\n",
  "Percent UTXOs in Profit": "A UTXO is in profit if the current price is higher than the price at the time it was created. Conversely, a UTXO is in loss if the current price is lower than the price at the time it was created. \n\nPercent UTXOs in Profit highlights the percentage of the total set of UTXOs which are currently in profit. In general, higher values may suggest market tops, while lower values may signal bottoms. However, Percent Supply in Profit and Net Unrealized Profit/Loss (NUPL) can often provide a clearer signal of tops and bottoms based on the same concept of examining average profit and loss across a network.\n\nPercent UTXOs in Profit is calculated by dividing the absolute number of UTXOs in Profit by the total number of UTXOs and converting to a percentage.\n\nIntroduced by Glassnode in November 2019.\n",

By simply staking PERI and minting pUSD, users can convert one asset to another or open long or short positions of leveraged contracts underlying various assets without any restriction. Pynth, stands for Peri Synthetic asset, is a synthetic asset which price follows to the price of the underlying asset. Pynths currently provided by PERI Exchange are Forex, Crypto Currency and Commodity.\n\nPERI exchange has no need of liquidity provider. For the transaction of converting Pynths, the counterparty is the debt pool collateralized by PERI and USDC staked by the holders, so the liquidity available in the pool is infinite and no slippage exists. As for leveraged Pynths, perpetual contracts trading, virtual AMM backed by the staked PERI is the mechanism to provide the liquidity. Thanks to vAMM's unique property, there is no liquidity provider involved in the trading so the stakers have no risk to lose their PERI nor USDC.\n\nThe stakers are incentivized by 3 types of rewords. 1. the trading fees taken and pooled whenever Pynths are exchanged or leveraged Pynths contracts are traded on PERI.exchange. 2. PERI inflation rewards designed to pay for staking PERI and USDC. 3. the profits share generated by PERI assets. They will be distributed to the Stakers based on the contribution to the network. PERI Asset is an A.I Arbitrage Trading system operated by fund raised by PERI sales. It creates profits by finding risk-free arbitrage in the traditional market finance market and the crypto market.\n",
  "PERI Token": "A utility token used to create a liquidity pool in the process of staking, generating the basic Pynth, pUSD. It is also a tool to be used for voting within PERI DAO, which will play a pivotal role in the development of PERI Finance. PERI holders will receive three different rewards by staking PERI or USDC and minting Pynths. The ratio of PERI to USDC will be 8:2, which can be changed by PERI DAO later.\n\nThe first reward comes from PERI inflationary supply policy. Initial supply of PERI will be 11,000,000 and 9,000,000 more will be issued for 40 months as compensation for staking with weekly interval, resulting in a total of 20,000,000 in circulation. 52 weeks after staking rewards start, inflation amount decreases weekly by 1.25%. After 40 months, the annual inflation rate will be fixed at 5%. 80% of the inflation reward will go to users who staked PERI and the rest to users staking USDC, which can be changed by PERIDAO later.\n\nThe second reward is the distribution of PERI.Assets' revenue. The managed funds come from 50% of the fund raised by PERI token sales, so the holders can be rewarded additional profits only by staking PERI. The profit only goes in proportion to those who maintain C-Ratio above 400% during rewards claiming period with PERI (50%) and BTC/ETH (50%).\n\nFinally, the distribution of commissions incurred in Pynths transactions and leveraged Pynths contract trading. By staking PERI and USDC, users can mint pUSD . Users can exchange it for the other Pynth such as pBTC or lock some amount of pUSD for opening leveraged Pynth position like pBTCpUSD, the system will take approximately 0.3% of the fee and transfer it to the fee pool which is to be distributed proportionately to the entitled PERI stakers. The fee rate of exchanging Pynths can vary depending on the assets.\n",
  "Periphery Contract": "Introduced in Uniswap v2, the periphery is a constellation of smart contracts designed to support domain-specific interactions with the core smart contracts of the Uniswap v2 and v3 automated market makers. Because of Uniswap's permissionless nature, the contracts have no special privileges, and are in fact only a small subset of the universe of possible periphery-like contracts. However, they are useful examples of how to safely and efficiently interact with Uniswap v2 and v3.\n\nIn the case of Uniswap v3, a periphery contract covers new functionalities that involve funds movement or position as well as collected swap fees management using the Non-Fungible token specification.\n\nThe Uniswap v2 contracts introduced the separation between the core and periphery contracts, where the core contracts are responsible for supporting liquidity providers, providing time weighted price feeds and enforcing core accounting invariants. The features designed to support or protect traders are implemented with separate contracts in the periphery that call into the core.\n",
  "PERL Token": "On PerlinX, PERL can be used as a liquidity and a collateral asset. You may stake PERL to provide liquidity to the PerlinX platform and receive rewards for doing so, or you may collateralize your PERL in order to generate synthetic assets eg. pxCarbon, pxGold, pxOil.\n",

  "Permissionless": "A system is said to be permissionless when it has no so-called \"gatekeepers.\" In the case of blockchains, we can say that Bitcoin is permissionless since no entity can forbid anybody else from using it or limiting its use for any purpose. The permissionless nature of cryptocurrency is often highlighted by Bitcoin proponents as one of its foremost features. Thanks to it being permissionless, Bitcoin and its blockchain can be used by political dissidents or other organizations blacklisted by the banking systems, such as Wikileaks or even criminals. No state can censor transactions on a permissionless blockchain.\n",
  "Permutations over Lagrange-bases for Oecumenical Noninteractive arguments of Knowledge": "A general-purpose zero-knowledge proof scheme. While improvements to general-purpose zero-knowledge proof protocols have been coming for years, what PLONK bring to the table is a series of enhancements that may greatly improve the usability and progress of these kinds of proofs in general.\n\nThe first improvement is that while PLONK still requires a trusted setup procedure similar to that needed for the SNARKs in Zcash, it is a \"universal and updateable\" trusted setup. This means two things: first, instead of there being one separate trusted setup for every program you want to prove things about, there is one single trusted setup for the whole scheme after which you can use the scheme with any program (up to some maximum size chosen when making the setup). Second, there is a way for multiple parties to participate in the trusted setup such that it is secure as long as any one of them is honest, and this multi-party procedure is fully sequential: first one person participates, then the second, then the third... The full set of participants does not even need to be known ahead of time; new participants could just add themselves to the end. This makes it easy for the trusted setup to have a large number of participants, making it quite safe in practice.\n\nThe second improvement is that the \"fancy cryptography\" it relies on is one single standardized component, called a \"polynomial commitment\". PLONK uses \"Kate commitments\", based on a trusted setup and elliptic curve pairings, but you can instead swap it out with other schemes, such as FRI (which would turn PLONK into a kind of STARK) or DARK (based on hidden-order groups). This means the scheme is theoretically compatible with any (achievable) tradeoff between proof size and security assumptions.\n",

The PNK ticker comes from \"Pinakions\" originating from Ancient Athens. These small bronze plates on which citizens' names were written were inserted into a randomizing machine that selected for participation in juries and certain civil service roles. The name of the token used by Kleros is a reference to this practice. For each dispute that is arbitrated by Kleros, some number of jurors are required. A jury as small as three people may provide an initial ruling of a dispute. Then if one of the parties decides to appeal the ruling, the number of jurors in subsequent rounds increases. PNK holders can stake their tokens in a Kleros court to indicate their availability to serve as jurors. However, eventually, they will implement specialized subcourts and PNK holders will be able to choose which subcourts to stake their token in).

  "POLIS Token": "A multifunctional governance token for Star Atlas, with applications both in-game and in directing real world economic policy.\n\nWithin the Star Atlas metaverse, political influence is yet another strategic consideration in the management of territory and the navigation of space. Controlling this political influence introduces a number of advantages for player status, which is represented by the POLIS token.\n\nHolders of POLIS will be in a unique position of jurisdictional ownership over entire regions, regardless of who owns title (NFT) to the land and equipment rights. These players will be able to restrict some of the activity that can occur while under their oversight, impose taxes on other players, charge tolls, and otherwise create a separate set of laws with which other players must observe. However, POLIS represents voting rights, not dictatorial ownership. In this regard, it will likely require multiple players to collaborate on these rules, fines, fees, tolls, etc., lest they be superseded by a more powerful group of players. Decentralized Autonomous Corporations would do well to take advantage of this tool.\n\nExternally, control of POLIS will enable the gaming community to influence decision making of the Star Atlas development team. This will follow a period of centralization of decision making, likely 2-3 years of game development and balance. At the conclusion of the centralized period, holders will be able to influence game economics (i.e. inflation rates), asset release schedules, game direction, and will otherwise provide some degree of ownership in development decision making.\n\nPOLIS distribution will take effect in two phases. The first phase consists of a 20% sale of the governance token during the Galactic Asset Offering. Following the GAO, the exclusive ability to generate POLIS relies on staking of ATLAS currency.\n",

If users want to know the future and receive the wisdom of the crowd, they must use $POLK.\n Mining: Users and LPs earn $POLK by making forecasts on the platform, and by providing liquidity to Polkamarkets.\n Direct Fees for Liquidity Providers (LPs): All markets on Polkamarkets pay a 0.3% trading fee. 2/3 of all trading fees (0.2%) on Polkamarkets will be paid to LPs in the token (ETH / DOT for example) in which they were collected. The remaining 1/3 of fees (0.1%) are used to auto-buy $POLK via smart contract on decentralised exchanges.\n Yield Farming: The 1/3 of all trading fees (0.1%) on Polkamarkets will be used to purchase $POLK on DEXs, to be paid out to LPs for their service of providing liquidity.\n Gamification: Achieving higher and higher tiers of earned $POLK will unlock exclusive NFTs, access to bigger markets, and special features.\n",
  "PolkaWar": "A decentralized fighting game platform on the blockchain network. Inspired by the NFT subfield, PolkaWar will create a vivid fighting game world. Players will build character systems with weapons and equipment with different levels, to engage in combat with other players; participate in quests in the game as well as buy and sell items in the marketplace.\n\nThe game system will have 3 types of characters including Warrior, Archer and Magician. Weapon system includes: Sword, Big Knife, Bow & Arrow, Gun, Tessen, Scepter, Magic Vase. Equipment system includes: Armor, Helmet, Wing, Mount. Each item will be designed according to the level upgrade model, with different stats and advancement conditions for each level.\n\nUnlike other NFT game platforms, PolkaWar will also include an in-game marketplace system, allowing players to buy, sell and auction items with each other. It's a way for the players to employ monetization and turn their valuable time/skills into a money generation opportunity for themselves. Consequently the higher the level/stats of the characters, weapons, and equipment, the more price they can fetch.\n\nIn addition, players can also redeem their NFTs or gaming items for real world objects through the PolkaWar Logistics system. The players are required to bid against other players for a chance to win and own these items. Through the logistics system, PolkaWar team will ship the product directly to the buyer's address. This promises to be a novel and very attractive function in the NFT marketplace field.\n",
  "Pollen": "Pollen is a lot of things; a DAO, an asset pool and a liquidity provider. It uses human capital and perfectly aligned interests to recalibrate and optimise, constantly rebalancing and aligning based on market opportunities and conditions. If the market tanks, the fund adjusts to weather the storm. If there are hidden market opportunities, the fund will seek them out and take advantage of them. n a 24 hour market, it is impossible to respond, the DAO acts on the token holders behalf with aligned interests and goals. One of the goals of Pollen's implementation is to create an index of Ethereum-based assets which can be used as less-volatile collateral in the DeFi ecosystem. It acts as a curated list of assets, which is continually optimised by our community. Our hypothesis is as follows; the higher the capitalisation of Pollen, the more optimised the composition of the Pollen index becomes, and therefore the greater the portfolio's market return.\n",

  "Precium": "A smart contract platform based on the Onyx chain for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions that allows users to create and use smart contracts simply and securely. Existing smart contract platforms require developers to code terms directly into a smart contract for users. However, this existing structure introduces a huge barrier to entry for the general public who may wish to create their own smart contracts. The Precium platform provides users with a template of code for various contract terms, lowering users' barrier to entry for creating smart contracts. Precium platform users only need to select and combine their preferred contract terms to create a complete contract. The platform then combines the selected coded terms from a template to provide a complete smart contract. Therefore, without any programming, users can employ smart contracts to engage in P2P transactions with their desired peers.\n",
  "Prediction Market": "Markets that bet on the occurrence of events in the future. They are used to bet on a variety of instances and circumstances, from the outcome of presidential elections to the results of a sporting event to the possibility of a policy proposal being passed by legislature.

  "Presence of Unused Variables": "Unused variables are allowed in Solidity and they do not pose a direct security issue. It is best practice though to avoid them as they can: (1) cause an increase in computations (and unnecessary gas consumption); (2) indicate bugs or malformed data structures and they are generally a sign of poor code quality; or (3) cause code noise and decrease readability of the code.\n",
  "Price Action": "The movement of a security's price plotted over time. Price action forms the basis for all technical analysis of a stock, commodity or other asset chart. Many short-term traders rely exclusively on price action and the formations and trends extrapolated from it to make trading decisions. Technical analysis as a practice is a derivative of price action since it uses past prices in calculations that can then be used to inform trading decisions.\n\nPrice action can be seen and interpreted using charts that plot prices over time. Traders use different chart compositions to improve their ability to spot and interpret trends, breakouts and reversals. Many traders use candlestick charts since they help better visualize price movements by displaying the open, high, low and close values in the context of up or down sessions.\n\nCandlestick patterns such as the Harami cross, engulfing pattern and three white soldiers are all examples of visually interpreted price action. There are many more candlestick formations that are generated off price action to set up an expectation of what will come next. These same formations can apply to other types of charts, including point and figure charts, box charts, box plots and so on.\n",
  "Price Chart": "A constantly changing display showing the historical and current prices that an asset (stock, cryptocurency, etc.) is sold at. Price charts have often have two ways to display changes in price. One is through a traditional line that goes up and down, and the other is through candlesticks, a type of chart that displays 4 points of information: the opening price, the closing price, the highest price, and the lowest price.\n",
  "Price Impact": "Price impact is an expression used to describe the correlation between an incoming order and the change in the price of the asset involved caused by the trade. Buy trades push the price of a given asset higher by exhausting the cheapest sell orders in the order book, while the opposite happens for selling trades. The extent to which the price moves as a result of trades largely depends on the liquidity of the trading pair affected. More liquid trading pairs will see a smaller price impact than those with lower trading volumes. Traders — especially those trading on markets with limited liquidity or those who make big trades — have to keep in mind the impact of their trade on the asset price. Their second buy trade will on average be more expensive than the first one because of their impact on the market. Monitoring and controlling price impact is one of the hottest areas of interest in research conducted by trading firms. Much effort is currently being dedicated to understanding how dependent the trade impact is on the trade size and how long it takes for its effect on asset price to manifest fully.\n",
  "Price-Taker": "An individual or company that must accept prevailing prices in a market, lacking the market share to influence market price on its own. All economic participants are considered to be price-takers in a market of perfect competition or one in which all companies sell an identical product, there are no barriers to entry or exit, every company has a relatively small market share, and all buyers have full information of the market. This holds true for producers and consumers of goods and services and for buyers and sellers in debt and equity markets.\n\nIn the stock market, individual investors are considered to be price-takers, while market-makers are those who set the bid and offer in a security. Being a market maker, however, does not mean that they can set any price they want. Market makers are in competition with one another and are constrained by the economic laws of the markets like supply and demand.\n",
  "Price-to-Earnings Ratio": "The ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to its per-share earnings (EPS). The price-to-earnings ratio is also sometimes known as the price multiple or the earnings multiple. P/E ratios are used by investors and analysts to determine the relative value of a company's shares in an apples-to-apples comparison. It can also be used to compare a company against its own historical record or to compare aggregate markets against one another or over time.\n\nTo determine the P/E value, one simply must divide the current stock price by the earnings per share (EPS). The current stock price (P) can be gleaned by plugging a stock's ticker symbol into any finance website, and although this concrete value reflects what investors must currently pay for a stock, the EPS is a slightly more nebulous figure.\n\nEPS comes in two main varieties. The first is a metric listed in the fundamentals section of most finance sites; with the notation \"P/E (TTM),\" where “TTM” is a Wall Street acronym for \"trailing 12 months.\" This number signals the company's performance over the past 12 months. The second type of EPS is found in a company's earnings release, which often provides EPS guidance. This is the company's best-educated guess of what it expects to earn in the future.\n\nSometimes, analysts are interested in long term valuation trends and consider the P/E 10 or P/E 30 measures, which average the past 10 or past 30 years of earnings, respectively. These measures are often used when trying to gauge the overall value of a stock index, such as the S&P 500 since these longer term measures can compensate for changes in the business cycle. The P/E ratio of the S&P 500 has fluctuated from a low of around 6x (in 1949) to over 120x (in 2009). The long-term average P/E for the S&P 500 is around 15x, meaning that the stocks that make up the index collectively command a premium 15 times greater than their weighted average earnings.\n",
  "Price-to-Sales Ratio": "A financial metric measuring how is a project valued in relation to its revenues. Calculated as a project's market cap divided by its annualized revenue. Annualized revenue is a forward-looking revenue estimate that is calculated based on a simple 30-day moving average.\n",
  "PRIME Token": "The utility and reward token in PrimeDAO. It borrows from the Web3 Sustainability Loop model in Token Engineering, where a mission-aligned and decentralized builder collective creates value for the ecosystem. The center of this model is that of a loop, where the collective creates value for the token, and the voters of Prime act as curators, either passing or dismissing work proposals submitted to the DAO. Through a recently submitted proposal, PrimeDAO has agreed that in its Growth phase, proposals that increase the utility of the PRIME token will be prioritized. Overall, the Growth phase strategy is oriented around stacking token sinks, where tokens are removed from the circulating supply through either: (1) Permanent removal — also known as token burning, where tokens are purchased and removed from the supply forever; or (2) Temporary removal — many mechanisms fit into this category. Tokens can be locked, or staked, or purchased by and returned to the DAO’s treasury for further use (referred to as “buyback and make”), and by doing so, are removed from the circulating supply.\n",
  "PrimeDAO": "A new system of open finance based on programmable money is being realized on Ethereum.

  "Proof of Person": "Involves employing regular checkpoint rituals — synchronous validation sessions — to certify a participants’ humanness for the consequent epoch. The validation requires solving of “flips-puzzles” easy for a human, difficult for a bot. The uniqueness of participants is proven by the fact that they must solve flip synchronously. Flips are decrypted at the same time worldwide. A single person is not able to validate herself multiple times because of the limited timeframe for the answers submission. After the validation session is over, the network reaches consensus about the new list of validated participants, and the date of the next validation session is scheduled. The bigger the network is, the less frequently the validation sessions happen. The validation status of a participant is not forever. It expires when the next epoch starts. Participants should prolong their validation status for every new epoch. To be allowed to take part in the next validation round, the participant must provide a certain number of newly created flips. To join the network, a new person must get an invitation from a validated participant.\n",
  "Proof of Reserve": "Chainlink Proof of Reserve provides smart contracts with the data required to calculate the true collateralization of any on-chain asset backed by off-chain reserves such as stablecoins and cross-chain assets.

  "Proof-of-Developer": "Any verification that provides evidence of a real, living software developer who created a cryptocurrency, in order to prevent an anonymous developer from making away with any raised funds without delivering a working model.\n",
  "Proof-of-Replication": "Often used in reference to Filecoin, the term refers to the way that a storage miner proves to the Filecoin (or other) network that they have an entirely unique copy of a piece of data held for the network. Proof-of-replication acts as a proof-of-retrievability mechanism inside of a proof-of-space mechanism. What does that actually mean? It means that PoRep allows a \"prover\" to show that they are really and truly using space to store replicas of a piece of information or data. Not only that, but PoRep means that the data that the prover is storing can easily be accessed, aka \"retrieved.\" In a proof-of-replication system, participants in the network want to join in as provers and store as much data as they can, because they get network rewards in exchange for their storage space. Some critics of proof-of-replication systems argue that while the use of proof-of-replication by storage providers creates durability (aka provides the assurance that data will be available even in the case of node failures), PoRep overlooks the fact that the replicated data must be transferred every time a new node is added to the redundancy pool — which can take up bandwidth.\n",
  "Proof-of-Spacetime": "Usually used in reference to Filecoin, the term refers to the way that a storage miner proves that they are continuing to store a unique piece of data for the network. PoSt is similar to proof-of-capacity in several ways: they both require participants in the network to have a financial incentive to participate honestly in the network, and have no benefit gained by harming the network. However, PoSt differs in that it lets network participants show that they have been physically storing data over a certain period of time. This is proved as randomly chosen miners will be selected and have their data read for verifications. According to the creators of proof-of-spacetime, Tal Moran and Ilan Orlov, this is called the “'Rational' Proofs of Space-Time because the true cost of storage is proportional to the product of storage capacity and the time that it is used.”\n",
  "Prophecy": "A crypto project focused on sound economic underpinnings backed by community and socialization through highly adapted core products, services, and offerings. Prophecy is a network of participants that come to consensus on the state of its internal economic policy. Built of 2 core components.

  "Protocol": "The set of rules that define interactions on a network, usually involving consensus, transaction validation, and network participation on a blockchain.\n",
  "Protocol Controlled Value": "Most DeFi platforms use a user-owned Total Value Locked (TVL) model. In these platforms, users receive an IOU and can withdraw assets at any time; lockups are increasingly common. Protocols can incentivize TVL via token distribution rewards. While this can lead to massive amounts of capital, it also creates the problem of mercenary capital: when liquidity is incentivized, DeFi platforms need to inflate and offer heavy rewards to maintain it. Deposited capital is then only loyal as long as the rewards are active. This is not sustainable long term as shiny new yield opportunities arise daily. There is a constant fear of rug-pulling when the rewards dry up and capital moves elsewhere.\n\nFei Protocol developed a Protocol Controlled Value (PCV) model to solve these issues. PCV is a subset of the concept of TVL, in which a platform outright owns the assets locked into the smart contracts. This is a stronger use case than the IOU common to most TVL applications, as the PCV is permanent. PCV gives the protocol more flexibility to engage in activities that are not profit-oriented. These activities can align with more fundamental goals, such as maintaining stability in the peg. As we have defined it, common use cases such as governance treasuries and insurance funds are types of PCV. Other possibilities include guaranteed liquidity or a price backstop for DeFi users. Unlike the IOU model, PCV is irrevocable. Governance tokens in a PCV platform accrue deeper value capture and corresponding responsibility.\n",

  "pTokens": "A tool enabling cross-chain composability. It is an essential component enabling Decentralized Financial (DeFi) DApps to be compatible with any crypto asset. The pTokens technology was designed to overcome the inherent \"walled garden\" limitation of blockchain protocols. The world of open finance grows larger and more sophisticated by the day. Yet this decentralized economy still suffers from a major drawback - a lack of cross-chain interoperability. In an ideal DeFi system, cryptocurrencies will move freely and seamlessly between exchanges, DApps and wallets. pTokens aim to solve the liquidity and interoperability riddle - a technology to connect any token with any blockchain.\n",
  "pTokens (DeFiPie)": "Each asset supported by the DeFiPIE Protocol is integrated through a pToken contract, which is an EIP-20 compliant representation of balances supplied to the protocol. By minting pTokens, users (1) earn interest through the pToken's exchange rate, which increases in value relative to the underlying asset, and (2) gain the ability to use pTokens as collateral.\n\npTokens are the primary means of interacting with the DeFiPIE Protocol; when a user mints, redeems, borrows, repays a borrow, liquidates a borrow, or transfers pTokens, he/she will do so using the pToken contract.\n\nThere are currently two types of pTokens: PErc20 and PEther. Though both types expose the EIP-20 interface, PErc20 wraps an underlying ERC-20 asset, while PEther simply wraps Ether itself. As such, the core functions which involve transferring an asset into the protocol have slightly different interfaces depending on the type of ptoken.\n\nEach pool has its own Deposit interest rate (APR). Interest isn't distributed; instead, simply by holding pTokens, users will earn interest. pTokens accumulates interest through their exchange rate — over time, each pToken becomes convertible into an increasing amount of it's underlying asset, even while the number of pTokens in your wallet stays the same.\n",

Each of the keys consists of a long string of alphanumeric characters that help to keep a user's holdings secure in the digital ecosystem.\n\nThe private key is known to the user alone and serves as the user's digital ID. The private key authorizes the user to spend, withdraw, transfer, or carry out any other transaction from his or her account. A sophisticated algorithm is applied to the private key to generate the public key, and both keys are stored in a digital wallet. \n\nThe public key is used to verify the digital signature, which proves ownership of the private key.\n",
  "Public Key Infrastructure": "Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a technology for authenticating users and devices in the digital world.

  "Quantitative Easing": "A form of unconventional monetary policy in which a central bank purchases longer-term securities from the open market in order to increase the money supply and encourage lending and investment. Buying these securities adds new money to the economy, and also serves to lower interest rates by bidding up fixed-income securities. It also expands the central bank's balance sheet. When short-term interest rates are either at or approaching zero, the normal open market operations of a central bank, which target interest rates, are no longer effective. Instead, a central bank can target specified amounts of assets to purchase. Quantitative easing increases the money supply by purchasing assets with newly-created bank reserves in order to provide banks with more liquidity.\n",

  "Quarters": "The world's first SEC Approved Gaming Currency and aims to be the universal currency for games.\n",
  "QUEEN Token": "The token for the main tranche, or main fund, as old-school financial industry might call it on Tranchess. Each Token QUEEN represents one share of the main fund. The main fund is a BTCB tracking index fund. QUEEN's Net Asset Value (NAV) tracks the BTC price on a fully correlated basis*.\n\nRather than holding BTC passively, investors can now swap their BTC for token QUEEN via a 'creation process' or buy from the \"Swap\" with USDC. In doing so, they will have the exact same BTC exposure and alongside the ability to farm Tranchess's CHESS tokens for further yield enhancement. CHESS is also key to receiving additional rebate from fees collected within Tranchess.\n\n(* with deduction of management fees.)\n",
  "Query fees": "The cost per query that is paid by the developer/dApp that’s querying a subgraph of Graph protocol, and earned by indexers and curators who process the queries and curate the subgraph being queried. Any user can subsidize the query fees for a specific subgraph or dApps will be rate-limited and will pay for their specific queries.

  "Rabby": "A browser extension wallet made by DeBank. Rabby is designed for multi-chain scenarios and it associates corresponding chain settings for each DeFi Dapp. When users visit a DeFi Dapp for the first time, Rabby will automatically choose the corresponding chain for this site based on their database. Users can also switch to another chain for a specific DeFi manually, but the settings will only work for that site.\n\nNowadays, on-chain transactions are no longer simple token transfers any more. Almost every transaction involves complicated contract call operations. The confirmation pop-up window from traditional extension wallets does not clearly explain what does the transaction exactly do. 99% of DeFi users are blindly signing transactions they don’t really understand at all, which is extremely risky for their life savings.\n\nBased on DeBank’s previous experience in DeFi, they managed to parse the transaction content for users in Rabby’s signing confirmation pop-up window. Rabby helps users understand what they are really signing and show them their estimated balance change before they sign.\n",
  "Radar Relay": "A non-custodial and peer-to-peer relayer built on top of the 0x protocol. We display and manage orders but do not hold assets or execute trades ourselves. When users find and complete orders they are settled on the Ethereum blockchain via 0x smart contracts.\n",

  "Ragequit": "In MolochDAO, Ragequit allows any member to cash out her shares instead of spending money on a proposal she disagrees with.\n",
  "RAI": "An ETH backed stable asset with a managed float regime. The RAIUSD exchange rate is determined by supply and demand while the protocol that issues RAI tries to stabilize its price by constantly de or revaluing it.\n\nThe supply and demand mechanic plays out between two parties: SAFE users (those who generate RAI with their ETH) and RAI holders (those who hold, speculate on or use RAI in other protocols and apps).\n\nCompared to protocols that try to defend a fixed exchange rate between their native stable asset and fiat (DAI/USD, sUSD/USD etc), RAI's monetary policy offers a couple of advantages:\n\nFlexibility: the protocol can devalue or revalue RAI in response to changes in RAI's market price. This process transfers value between SAFE users and RAI holders and incentivizes both parties to bring the market price back to a target chosen by the protocol. The mechanism is similar to countries devaluing or revaluing their currencies in order to combat a trade imbalance. The \"trade imbalance\" in RAI's case happens between RAI and SAFE users\n\nDiscretion: the protocol itself is free to change the target exchange rate to its own advantage. It can attract or repel capital whenever it wants.\n\nAt the same time, a managed float can cause uncertainty due to the fact that the price varies day by day. This uncertainty can be beneficial though: developers are incentivized to build all sorts of derivative products on top of RAI (such as futures and options) in order to take advantage of its repricing mechanism.\n",
  "Raid Guild": "A Decentralized Collective of Mercenaries Ready to Slay Your Web3 Product Demons. Through the MetaCartel network, the DAO assembled a fellowship of the best builders, designers and hustlers in the space in order to make this future a reality.

  "Raiden Network": "An off-chain scaling solution, enabling near-instant, low-fee and scalable payments. It’s complementary to the Ethereum blockchain and works with any ERC20 compatible token. The Raiden project is work in progress. Its goal is to research state channel technology, define protocols and develop reference implementations. It exists as an infrastructure layer on top of the Ethereum blockchain. While the basic idea is simple, the underlying protocol is quite complex and the implementation non-trivial. Nonetheless the technicalities can be abstracted away, such that developers can interface with a rather simple API to build scalable decentralized applications based on the Raiden Network.\n",
  "Raiden Network Token": "An Ethereum ERC-20 cryptocurrency for micropayments. RDN was created during the RDN token launch in October/November 2017.

The mobile wallet is available on the Apple App Store.\n",
  "Rainbow Bridge": "The ETH ↔ NEAR Rainbow Bridge is a trustless, permissionless, and generic protocol for connecting blockchains. The bridge protocol removes the need to trust anyone except the security of the connected chains. Anyone can deploy a new bridge, use an existing bridge, or join the maintenance of an existing bridge without getting approval from anyone else.\n\nThe Rainbow Bridge is also generic in that it allows any information that is cryptographically provable on NEAR to be usable in Ethereum contracts and vice versa — including the ability to read the state and schedule calls with callbacks on the other chain. This means a user can vote with their ETH balance in a NEAR DAO without sending a transaction on Ethereum.\n\nThe nature of the Rainbow Bridge remains fully decentralized and adaptable to any future protocol changes on either side.\n",
  "Rainicorn": "A deflationary NFT farming token that provides stakers with exclusive NFT drops from both well-known, and highly talented emerging artists. They have two staking pools, one where users can stake $RAINI to earn Rainbows, and another where users can stake RAINI/ETH (on Ethereum) or RAINI/BNB (on Binance Smart Chain) to earn Unicorns. Unicorns will be valued higher than Rainbows to compensate for impermanent loss.\n\nUsers will then be able to use these points to claim NFTs from their forthcoming drops. These NFTs can be \"levelled up\" to Gold or Chroma editions through a gamified system, and Gold and Chroma editions can be staked in earning pools which will pay out $RAINI.\n\nOutside of this core platform offering, they are also building a Trading Card Game set within the Raini universe. This game will leverage their Trading Cards, especially those exclusively available with Unicorns and Rainbows via their NFT drops.\n\nThey are also building an IDO Launchpad.\n\nOn the environmental front, there is no question that NFTs have received flak for the emissions associated with transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. They are therefore committing to offsetting all carbon output with monthly donations to Greening Australia — a non-government organisation founded in 1982 with a strong history in reforestation and habitat repair. Their services are sorely needed after a terrible year in 2020 for Australia with rampant bushfires destroying much of the East Coast's bushland.\n",

It has a clear and self-explanatory UX, approachable fees and wide offer of supported payment methods available straight from your dApp. We don’t overcomplicate stuff with excessive KYC - the bare minimum will do for us. You, a developer, will like it too - just check the SDK package.\n",
  "Range Order": "In Uniswap v3, a Range Order is an order with two prices: An upper price and a lower price. The Uniswap v3 Liquidity Provider gives the two prices of the range order. A Liquidity Provider will enter their range order to tell other users on the exchange their preference for where they think prices will be accepted by market participants. The range order is the price range that users on the exchange can use to complete an exchange transaction.\n\nFor example, Alice will enter a Range order on Uniswap v3 of $0.99 and $1.01 so that her liquidity is available at those prices for any exchange users that want to take that price.\n\nRange Orders are similar to Limit Orders, but have two main differences in the Uniswap v3 Automated Market Maker.\n\nRange orders have a limit as to how small or narrow they can be. A Range order that is crossed must be withdrawn by the user. If the user does not withdraw their liquidity, if the price changes direction and crosses the range again, the trade will be reversed.\n",
  "Range-bound Trading": "A trading strategy that seeks to identify and capitalize on stocks trading in price channels.

  "Rari Capital": "An easy interface to earn yield within DeFi. It began delivering on this mission in a safe way that enables individuals to autonomously and easily earn yield on their stable assets in a lossless manner. From there, it transformed into a solution that leveraged yield farming strategies to increase the returns offered to users. Now, Rari Capital is an autonomous solution to earn yield within any risk appetite. The liquidity ending up in Rari Capital empowers the protocol to work in an expansionary way: providing other projects (L1, L2, DeFi projects) with liquidity and even terraforming itself into a base DeFi layer. Rari Capital aims to attract all of DeFi's liquidity, deploying it in the most capital efficient and globally beneficial manner. Being aware of the negative impacts of Ethereum (gas, slowness, scalability, etc.), we are fully prepared to transverse capital between chain through Rari-made bridges. Currently, the product optimizes for yield across a series of stable-assets (swapping via 0x) in the stable and yield pools and Ethereum in the ETH pool. It earns yield by lending and farming across various DeFi protocols like Compound, dYdX, KeeperDAO, mStable, yEarn, and Aave. The team is actively expanding our strategy set to focus on more sustainable yields off of the chain. We expect lending to compose the minority of the pool's allocation once mass protocol expansion has begun.\n",
  "Rari Fund Token": "Each user's share of the Rari Capital fund is determined by their RFT balance. When you deposit funds to Rari, an equivalent amount of RFT (Rari Fund Token) is minted to your account. When you withdraw funds to Rari, the equivalent amount of RFT is burned from your account. As soon as you deposit, you start earning yield. Essentially, fund holdings and yield are split up proportionally across RFT holders by their USD balances. RFT's value is equivalent to stablecoins + the yield accrued on them.\n",
  "Rari Governance Token": "Governance token of Rari Capital. It can be used to propose and vote proposals made by the Rari Team or fellow token-holding community members. Users can also delegate their voting power to another address to pool voting power. RGT also enables transaction discounts for users, a unique feature of $RGT and the Rari Protocol. By staking held $RGT tokens in Rari, users can gain discounts on Rari Protocol fees. Rari normally charges a 9.5% fee on all gains, however, staking $RGT can reduce these fees over certain intervals. Fees accumulate through time and discounts are determined by the ratio between deposited funds to staked $RGT. The staking discount is only in effect when Rari is staked through our platform. If the $RGT tokens are withdrawn, the discount is not active. The yearly countdown begins from whenever this fee system goes live. The RGT token can be used to formalize a DAO that is responsible for maintaining the Rari Protocol through the following processes: (1) Creating proposals that will better the Rari Protocol, and (2) Creating proposals that will better the Rari Protocol.\n",

As its name suggests, this is a process where you attempt to raise the rarest Aavegotchis, and get rewarded for doing so.\n\nIn each Rarity Farming period, the rarest Aavegotchis will receive a distribution of GHST rewards (derived from all sales involving GHST) that can be claimed by their owners.\n\nInitially, there will be three categories of rarity farming rewards: (1) Aavegotchi Rarity Scores by Base Rarity Score/Absolute Rarity Score, (2) Kinship Scores, and (3) Experience. For each category, Rarity Farming rewards are distributed based on a descending curve, with the top few Aavegotchis earning more GHST rewards than other Aavegotchis who are positioned lower on the curve. There will be a cut-off point where Aavegotchis below that point do not receive any rewards.\n",

You can hold on to the exact amount you invested and can spend and transfer it at will. You can also decide who benefits from the generated interest. rDai is a fungible ERC20 token meaning a holder can always redeem it 1:1 for DAI\n",
  "rDPX Token": "A token minted and distributed for any losses incurred by Dopex pool participants. The amount of tokens minted are determined based on the net value of losses incurred at the end of a pool's epoch. A percentage of the losses, which is determined by governance is minted for all pool participants after the epoch has ended. \n\nrDPX while having a no cap supply - has mechanisms in-place to avoid it from being valueless while also providing intrinsic value to the token.\n \n rDPX would be a fee requirement for future app layer additions to Dopex such as vaults.\n Dopex would support rDPX as collateral to borrow funds from Margin to leverage option positions.\n rDPX would be usable as collateral to mint synthetic assets, commodities etc. which could further be used to create options for synthetic non-crypto assets.\n Fee accrual can be boosted via staking rDPX.\n\nSince rDPX would initially not have a set emission curve - scarcity may prevail initially if purchasers aren't net profitable. The emission mechanism could be changed in the future via governance votes.\n",
  "Re-entrancy": "When a contract \"calls\" another account, it can choose the amount of gas it allows the called party to use. If the target account is a contract, it will be executed and can use the provided gas budget. If such a contract is malicious and the gas budget is high enough, it can try to call back in the caller — a re-entrant call. If the caller's implementation is not re-entrant, for example because it did not update his internal state containing balances information, the attacker can use this vulnerability to drain funds out of the vulnerable contract. This vulnerability was used in TheDAO exploit, essentially causing the Ethereum community to decide to rollback to a previous state using a hard-fork.\n",
  "Ready Player Cat": "A limited NFT Collection of 5,000 Ready Player Cat NFTs - that represents both unique digital collectibles on the ETH blockchain as well as MAO DAO's membership to share part of the Play-to-earn profits from Axie Infinity and future governance rights.\n\nYour RPC will also give you access to MAO DAO's RANKING GUILD, a ranking board that can change your NFTs' name and shows your ranking decided by contribution and experience in the big Metaverse community.

  "Reality Cards": "A hybrid of NFT art and prediction markets. Each outcome is a unique Non Fungible Token (NFT), and instead of betting on an outcome, you own it (or to be more accurate, you rent it). Concepts such as shares, bids, asks do not exist- even 'odds' are abstracted away, replaced by a 'daily rental price'. At the end of the event, the longest owner of each outcome keeps it forever (regardless of whether or not the outcome was correct), it thus becomes a collectable.\n",
  "Reality Cards Governance Token": "Governance token of Reality Cards. The token will have the following uses: (1) Project governance, (2) Final layer of outcome resolution if there are continued disputes, (3) Market curation, and (4) Incentivise platform use via liquidity mining. The token has yet to be implemented.\n",
  "Realized Capitalization": "A variation of market capitalization that values each UTXO based on the price when it was last moved, as opposed to its current value. As such, it represents the realized value of all the coins in the network, as opposed to their market value. Realized cap reduces the impact of lost and long dormant coins, and weights coins according to their actual presence in the economy of a given chain. When a coin that was last moved at significantly cheaper prices is spent, it will re-value the coins to the current price, and thus increase realized cap by a corresponding amount. Similarly, if a coin is spent at a price lower than when it was last moved, it will re-value to a cheaper price and have a corresponding decrease on realized cap. Given realized cap values each coin at the time last moved, it can be considered a proxy for the value 'stored' or 'saved' in the asset. This metric can therefore be considered an estimate of the aggregate cost basis for the network and makes it a powerful baseline for the creation of additional metrics (e.g. MVRV and NUPL).\n",
  "Realized Loss": "The total loss (USD value) of all moved coins whose price at their last movement was higher than the price at the current movement. Realized Loss is calculated by subtracting the price at the time of the current spent output creation from the price when coins were previously moved (for all spent outputs where the price when moved is lower than the price when the coins were previously moved), and summing these totals for all coins moved within the given time period. Introduced by Glassnode in June 2020.\n",
  "Realized Profit": "The total profit (USD value) of all moved coins whose price at their last movement was lower than the price at the current movement. Realized Profit is calculated by subtracting the price when coins were previously moved from the price at the time of the current spent output creation (for all spent outputs where the price when moved is greater than the price when the coins were previously moved), and summing these totals for all coins moved within the given time period. Introduced by Glassnode in June 2020.\n",
  "Realized variance": "The sum of squared returns. For instance, the realized variance (RV) can be the sum of squared daily returns for a particular month, which would yield a measure of price variation over this month. More commonly, the realized variance is computed as the sum of squared intraday returns for a particular day. The realized variance is useful because it provides a relatively accurate measure of volatility which is useful for many purposes, including volatility forecasting and forecast evaluation.\n",
  "RealT": "A platform for investing in U.S. real estate. Our mission is to democratize access to real estate investment opportunities, curated by a team of real estate professionals.

  "Rehypothecation": "A practice whereby banks and brokers use, for their own purposes, assets that have been posted as collateral by their clients. Clients who permit rehypothecation of their collateral may be compensated either through a lower cost of borrowing or a rebate on fees. In a typical example of rehypothecation, securities that have been posted with a prime brokerage as collateral by a hedge fund are used by the brokerage to back its own transactions and trades.\n\nRehypothecation was a common practice until 2007, but hedge funds became much more wary about it in the wake of the Lehman Brothers collapse and subsequent credit crunch in 2008-09.

  "Remix": "An Ethereum integrated development environment (IDE).\n",
  "Remme": "An open-source solution that improves the security of data transmission and online communication between browsers, apps, servers, and devices by utilizing a decentralized environment organized in a distributed network. It is designed as a solution to provide a robust and secure alternative to traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) systems, which often become a single point of failure. Remme Protocol is based on the fork of EOSIO, enables each element of the system to be customized, which is exactly what the team has done to create the perfect custom blockchain REMChain. Remme Protocol utilizes the only known decentralized consensus algorithm proven capable of meeting the performance requirements of PKI(d) applications on the blockchain, Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS). Under this algorithm, those who hold a certain amount of tokens on a blockchain adopting the protocol software may select Block Producers (BPs) through a continuous voting mechanism.\n",
  "Remote Procedure Call": "In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPCs are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures are largely the same whether they are local or remote, but usually they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important.\n\nRPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine, they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is different. Many different (often incompatible) technologies have been used to implement the concept.\n",
  "Ren Project": "An open protocol that enables the movement of value between blockchains. It consists of a distributed team of experienced blockchain developers, designers and communication experts.

  "REN Token": "Native token of Ren Project. Their product, RenVM, is powered by thousands of independently operated machines, known as Darknodes, which require bonds of 100K REN tokens to run. The bond of every Darknode represents a commitment to good behaviour and can be slashed if 1) the Darknode behaves maliciously or 2) if it is responsible for the loss of assets (and the slashed bonds can then be used to restore the lost assets).\n",
  "Render Network": "The Render Network™, through the use of RNDR™ tokens, is the first network to transform the power of GPU compute into a decentralized economy of connected 3D assets.\n\nOTOY’s vision is to distribute the framework of the existing rendering service in OctaneRender® using RNDR, a digital token built on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nThe Render Network is designed to connect users looking to perform render jobs with people who have idle GPUs to process the renders. Owners would connect their GPUs to the Render Network in order to receive and complete rendering jobs using OctaneRender. Users would send RNDR to the individual performing the render work and OTOY would receive a small percentage of RNDR for facilitating the transaction and running the Render Network.\n",
  "RenFT": "A protocol layer that enables peer to peer renting of ERC-721 non-fungible tokens (NFTs), while also generating interest yield. reNFT enables holders of NFT assets to put them to work by renting out gaming assets to use in blockchain gaming experiences, digital art, or any other NFT asset.

A user can rent an NFT by simply staking collateral + the set price as well as entering a desired lease duration.\n",
  "RenVM": "A Byzantine fault tolerant (BFT) network that enables universal interoperability between blockchains. By combining consensus with secure multi-party computation (MPC) algorithms, RenVM is able to instantiate a decentralised, permission-less, and trust-less custodian capable of locking assets on one chain and minting one-to-one pegged representations of them on other chains. In this way, users are able to interact with multiple applications, multiple assets, and multiple chains with only one transaction.\n",
  "REP (PrimeDAO)": "PrimeDAO practices Holographic Consensus—a governance mechanism native to DAOs powered by DAOstack that streamlines the attention of the collective. Central to Holographic Consensus is Reputation (REP), non-transferable voting rights used for voting on proposals. Reputation can be earned by contributing to the development of PrimeDAO.

  "Republic Realm": "A digital real estate investor and developer in the metaverse. Republic Realm intends to focus on the acquisition, management, development, and sale of virtual land across existing metaverses including Decentraland, the first and most established multiplayer role-playing metaverse built on the Ethereum blockchain, and The Sandbox, a content-rich, community-driven gaming platform that allows individuals to create, publish, and monetize a variety of unique experiences on a decentralized platform. Republic Realm will also invest across other metaverses, while allocating capital to new projects and opportunities as they emerge.​\n\nInvestment in digital real estate occurs through the purchase and exchange of non-fungible tokens (or NFTs), a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not mutually interchangeable. This is in contrast to cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, and many network or utility tokens that are fungible in nature. Each NFT is distinct or unique, it is indivisible and it is not interchangeable.\n",
  "Reputation Token": "Token in the Augur protocol. Reputation (REP) and (REPv2) is a cryptocurrency, used by reporters during market dispute phases of Augur. REP and REPv2 holders must perform work, in the form of staking their REP or REPv2 on correct outcomes, to receive a portion of the markets settlement fees. If you do not report correctly, you do not get the fees. If you report incorrectly, you lose your REP or REPv2. If you don’t participate in a fork (when the network has a very large dispute over an outcome), you permanently lose your ability to migrate your REP or REPv2 to a forked universe, making it functionally useless within the used version of the Augur Protocol, and in theory making it worthless. Passive holders of Reputation (REP or REPv2) that are not using their Reputation (REP or REPv2) within the Augur protocol to stake on disputes and forks are penalized. The treatment of REP and REPv2 within the Augur protocol is governed not by the Forecast Foundation but by the protocols smart contracts as described in the Augur white paper and documentation.\n",
  "Request for Quotation Exchanges": "Request for quotation is a common practice used in daily life and business and can simply be thought of as price comparison shopping or pricing on demand. In RFQs, the role of the exchange operator (or smart contract) is to organize and keep track of quotation providers for a taker, assist in the coordination of requesting and receiving quotes, and finally provide a method for effecting (settling) the transaction once agreed.\n",
  "Request Protocol": "An open and unique database for payment requests including invoices or individual payment requests. It is aimed to be universal and to power products used by different companies from startups to large organizations, from the private to the public sector. The Request Protocol is the core of Request. It's the bottom layer that defines and handles the data of a request and persists them to a distributed ledger to make Request open, trustless, secure and resilient. The Request Protocol has one basic purpose: to persist, on a distributed ledger, data representing requests and to be able to retrieve these data in an efficient way. To organize these different purposes, the Request Protocol follows the layered architecture pattern. Each layer is responsible for a specific task and a specific level of abstraction. This layered architecture also simplifies the understandability of the code, we believe it's an important matter for an open-source project. The protocol is composed of four layers: (1) Request logic, (2) Transaction, (3) Data Access, and (4) Storage.\n",

  "Requirement Violation": "The Solidity require() construct is meant to validate external inputs of a function. In most cases, such external inputs are provided by callers, but they may also be returned by callees. In the former case, we refer to them as precondition violations. Violations of a requirement can indicate one of two possible issues: (1) A bug exists in the contract that provided the external input; or (2) The condition used to express the requirement is too strong. If the required logical condition is too strong, it should be weakened to allow all valid external inputs. Otherwise, the bug must be in the contract that provided the external input and one should consider fixing its code by making sure no invalid inputs are provided.\n",
  "Resardis": "An order book based decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX). It promises a safe and user-friendly trading experience to cryptocurrency investors.

  "Reserve Rights Token": "A cryptocurrency used to facilitate the stability of the Reserve token.\n",
  "Reserve Risk": "A cyclical indicator that tracks the risk-reward balance relative to the confidence and conviction of long-term holders. It provides a long-term cyclical oscillator that models the ratio between the current price (incentive to sell) and the conviction of long term investors (opportunity cost of not selling).\n\nThe general principles that underpin Reserve Risk are as follows:\n Every coin that is not spent accumulates coin-days which quantify how long it has been dormant. This is good tool for measuring the conviction of strong hand HODLers.\n As price increases, the incentive to sell and realise these profits also increases. As a result, we typically see HODLers spending their coins as Bull Markets progress.\n Stronger hands will resist the temptation to sell and this collective action builds up an 'opportunity cost'. Every day HODLers actively decide NOT to sell increases the cumulative unspent 'opportunity cost' (called the HODL bank).\n Reserve Risk takes the ratio between the current price (incentive to sell) and this cumulative 'opportunity cost' (HODL bank). In other words, Reserve Risk compares the incentive to sell, to the strength of HODLers who have resisted the temptation.\n\nThe Reserve Risk oscillator can be seen to oscillate in line with the macro bull/bear market cycles. It has well defined peaks in line with blow-off tops, and lengthy periods of relative undervaluation during bear market bottoms and into early bull markets.\n\nMetric coined by Hans Hauge in May 2019.\n",

  "Resistance": "The price at which the price of an asset meets pressure on its way up by the emergence of a growing number of sellers who wish to sell at that price. Resistance levels can be short-lived if new information comes to light that changes the overall market's attitude toward the asset, or they can be long-lasting. In terms of technical analysis, the simple resistance level can be charted by drawing a line along the highest highs for the time period being considered. Resistance can be contrasted with support. \n\nDepending on price action, this line can be flat or slanted. There are, however, more advanced ways to identify resistance incorporating bands, trendlines and moving averages.\n",

  "Safety Incentives": "Ensures the safety of the protocol by incentivizing AAVE holders to participate in the Safety Module. This is achieved with a set of incentives pushing behaviour to naturally create a positive feedback loop within the Aave Protocol. In that sense, the essence of those systemic incentives is to materially fade away while having lasting impact on participants behaviour. This behaviour materializes with the birth of policy motivated agents that have incorporated the sustainability of the system they now belong to.\n",
  "Safety Module": "The primary mechanism for securing the Aave Protocol is the incentivization of AAVE holders to lock tokens into a Smart Contract-based component called the Safety Module (SM). The locked AAVE will be used as a mitigation tool in case of a Shortfall Event within the money markets that belong to the Aave ecosystem. A Shortfall Event occurs when there is a deficit. The interpretation for the occurrence of a Shortfall Event is subject to the Protocol Governance vote, detailed in Governance. In the instance of a Shortfall Event, part of the locked AAVE are auctioned on the market to be sold against the assets needed to mitigate the occurred deficit. The SM includes a built-in backstop mechanism to prevent excess flow of AAVE into the open market that would further reduce the value of AAVE itself. Participants’ decision to lock AAVE into the SM assumes the acceptance of a potential Shortfall Event as they secure the protocol in return for receiving rewards, in the form of Safety Incentives (SI) and fee distributions. To contribute to the safety of the protocol and receive incentives, AAVE holders will deposit their tokens into the SM. In return, they will receive a tokenized position that can be freely moved within the underlying network. The holder of the tokenized position can redeem their share from the SM at any time, triggering a cooldown period of one week (which can be further extended by the governance). SI rewards are subject to a cooldown period where tokens are unclaimable. The cooldown period is set to seven days. However, fees generated by the protocol are continuously allocated to the users participating in the SM and can be withdrawn. Fees generated from the protocol are redistributed to the SI participants. The reward plan for the SI is designed to incentivize participants contributing to the safety of the protocol in its early stages. The SI emission will be controlled by the governance and adjusted to the protocol's needs. All fees distributions mechanisms are only potential until they go through AIP process and governance vote. In case the SM is not able to cover all of the deficit incurred, the Protocol Governance can trigger an ad-hoc Recovery Issuance event. In such a scenario, new AAVE is issued and sold in an open auction for market price prioritizing the Backstop Module. The issuance of AAVE in case of a Shortfall Event is mitigated by the existence of the SM. Prior to any issuance, the deficit of the protocol is first covered by the SM reserves.\n",

  "Sandwich Attack": "A common attack in DeFi. Upon observing a trade of asset X for asset Y, an attacker frontruns the victim's trade by also buying asset Y, lets the victim execute the trade, and then backruns (executes after) the victim by trading back the amount gained in the first trade. Intuitively, one uses the knowledge that someone’s going to buy an asset, and that this trade will increase its price, to make a profit. The attacker’s plan is to buy this asset cheap, let the victim buy at an increased price, and then sell the received amount again at a higher price afterwards.\n\nThese attacks often appear in the wild due to the public nature of blockchains, all transactions can be observed by anyone in the mempool (unless one has a special direct link to a mining pool). Alternatively, smart contracts may contain functions without access restrictions performing such a trade. These functions often exist for claiming LP reward tokens and immediately swapping them for some other token using a DEX.\n\nSandwich attacks are not new, Vitalik already talked about them in the context of Uniswap in 2018.\n",

  "Secure Multi-Party Computation": "Cryptography term that allows a computation to be distributed across multiple different parties, and no one party can see the other parties' data — it is kept private. In blockchain, this means that nodes can jointly compute a function while keeping the inputs private from everyone, including the nodes that power them. SMPC also means that analysts are able to securely and privately compute distributed data without ever exposing it publicly.\n",
  "Secure Proof of Stake": "Elrond's approach for consensus is called Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS). It innovates in the manner in which validator nodes are selected for consensus out of a shard and also in the steps taken by the validators to complete the consensus process as efficiently as possible. Let's take a look.\n\nAt the beginning of each round, SPoS selects validators for consensus using a randomness source that can be neither predicted, nor influenced. It is surprisingly simple, requiring only to be calculated from the previous block and to be signed by the consensus leader of the current round (also known as the block proposer). The resulting signature will be the randomness source for the next round, and due to its reliance on the immediately preceding block, it cannot be known more than a round in advance.\n\nIn each round, a new consensus group is selected to propose a block. But only one validator in the group will be the block proposer. This is the validator in the consensus group which has the hash of the public key and randomness source is the smallest, numerically. The block proposer will produce the block for the round, and the rest of the consensus group will validate and sign it.\n\nThe time necessary for random selection of the consensus group is exceptionally short (around 100 ms, often less). This efficiency is a consequence of the fact that consensus selection is deterministic once the randomness source is known, thus there is no communication requirement. This allows total round times on the order of mere seconds.\n\nThere is a security advantage to having rounds this short: SPoS is built on the premise that a malevolent actor cannot adapt faster than the timeframe allowed by a round in order to influence the block that will be proposed.\n\nLike other Proof of Stake methods, SPoS selects validator nodes for consensus based on the amount of EGLD tokens staked by their operators. Additionally, each validator has an individual rating score that is taken into account - stake alone may only influence, but not completely determine the selection for consensus. Rating expresses the past behavior of the specific validator and is taken into account during consensus selection: validators with a higher rating are more likely to be selected. The rating of a validator is recalculated at the end of each epoch, with a few specific exceptions when rating is adjusted immediately. This way, SPoS promotes meritocracy among validators, encouraging their operators to keep them running smoothly.\n",

  "Sharding": "The main problem in scalability that blockchains, including Ethereum, currently face is: every node has to verify and execute every transaction.\n\nIn computer science, there are two main approaches to scaling:\n\nScaling vertically: basically, make nodes more and more powerful.\nScaling horizontally: basically, add more nodes.\n\nFor decentralization, blockchains need to scale horizontally. A goal of Ethereum 2.0, also called eth2 or Serenity, is for nodes to run on consumer hardware. Sharding is the term for horizontally partitioning a database.\n\nGenerally, a shard chain has a subset of nodes processing it. Virtual miners, validators, are assigned to shards, and only process and validate transactions in that shard (chain).\n\nEthereum’s shards have a dynamic subset of nodes processing it block-by-block.\n\nThe main challenge with sharding a blockchain is the security of shards. Since validators are spread out across shards, malicious validators could takeover a single shard.\n\nA key part to a solution:\n\nrandom shuffling of validators, where every shard block has a (pseudo) randomly chosen committee of validators, ensures that it is mathematically improbable that an attacker controlling less than ⅓ of all validators can attack a single shard\n\nFraud proofs, custody proofs, and data availability checks are also important security components.\n\nThe current eth2 plan is for 64 shards.\n",
  "ShardMarketCap.io": "Website that shows the market cap of NFT shards for each NFT project. It is powered by DappRadar.\n",
  "Sharpe Ratio": "Ratio that is used to help investors understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. Volatility is a measure of the price fluctuations of an asset or portfolio. Subtracting the risk-free rate from the mean return allows an investor to better isolate the profits associated with risk-taking activities. The risk-free rate of return is the return on an investment with zero risk, meaning it's the return investors could expect for taking no risk. The yield for a U.S. Treasury bond, for example, could be used as the risk-free rate. Generally, the greater the value of the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.\n\n",
  "Shell Protocol": "The objective of the Shell Protocol is to create an internet monetary system using stablecoins as building blocks. The first release is a liquidity pool optimized for stablecoin-to-stablecoin trades. It has weights, deep liquidity, protections against a broken peg and dynamic fees. It can also provide liquidity directly between stablecoin derivatives such as cTokens and aTokens. The goal for this iteration is to develop a framework for flexible bonding curves that can adapt to new use cases and market conditions. Liquidity provider shares are called “shells” because they are containers for the value held by the pool, just as living shells are containers for the organism inside. Shells are natively liquid, diversify exposure and earn yield. They have the potential to become the primary means of storing and transacting value.\n",
  "SHER Token": "The governance token for the Sherlock protocol. The governance functions of the SHER token will increase over time as the protocol matures. In the short-term, SHER token will be used for added incentives to stakers in staking pools as well as for compensation to the security team.\n\nAllowing staking into a staking pool with SHER tokens is not a good idea for two reasons:\n1. As stakers in the staking pools, SHER holders will be biased to favor stakers over protocols which could hurt their objectivity in making good decisions for the Sherlock protocol as a whole.\n2. In the event of an exploit at one of our covered protocols, it's reasonable to assume SHER might drop in price. For this reason, SHER is not well-suited to being collateral in the staking pools.\n",
  "Sherlock": "A protocol on the Ethereum blockchain that protects Decentralized Finance (DeFi) users from exploits with proprietary security analysis and protocol-level coverage.\n\nThere are 3 main participants in the Sherlock ecosystem:\n Protocols\n Stakers\n Security team\n\nProtocols pay Sherlock a small fee in return for repayment in the event of a hack. A protocol will indicate how much value they want insured ($1Bn, a specific pool, etc.), and Sherlock will work with each protocol individually to draft a coverage agreement that outlines exactly what types of events/risks they want covered. Then Sherlock's security team will conduct a thorough assessment over the course of a few days or weeks to understand the risks related to a protocol. Then the security team will work with Sherlock's risk team to determine the pricing for the protocol. If the protocol agrees to the pricing, they will start streaming payment to Sherlock block-by-block. In return, whenever a hack occurs at the protocol (within coverage), Sherlock will repay the hack amount in full. Sherlock's claims committee will be the final arbiters in deciding whether a certain hack falls under coverage and therefore should be paid out.\n\nStakers stake funds into the staking pools in return for what should be one of the highest APYs in DeFi. Any token on the whitelist of tokens (ETH, DAI, etc.) can be staked into the staking pools. The APY stakers will receive is made up of 3 streams:\n Fees from protocol customers (this will eventually be the biggest stream)\n Interest earned from depositing user stakes on lending protocols (Aave, Compound etc.)\n Incentive rewards paid in SHER (Sherlock's governance token)\n\nIn return for these streams, a staker's funds are at risk of being all or partially liquidated if a significant covered event (e.g. hack) occurs at one of the protocols covered by Sherlock (or possibly a protocol that the covered protocol depends on). Despite the risk, stakers are incentivized to stake because:\n They are paid a high and commensurate APY for the risk\n They see that the security team's incentives are aligned with stakers\n They are senior to the \"first money out\" pool and any affected protocol's deductible so staker funds are only at risk once those pools are fully liquidated\n\nSherlock's security team will provide input to the pricing of coverage for protocols (alongside the Sherlock risk team). The security assessment process for a protocol will depend on what areas of protection the protocol has chosen. Areas of assessment include protocol smart contracts, architecture, upgradability risks, economic risks, protocol dependencies (composability), oracle manipulation risks, admin key risk, processes for shipping secure code, \"emergency\" mechanisms for limiting hack magnitudes, etc.\nThe security team will be incentivized to set a floor on the coverage pricing because the bulk of their compensation will depend on the dollar value of hacks vs. the price paid by the protocol for coverage over defined time intervals.\n\nTo put it simply, if stakers in the staking pools are well-compensated by a protocol's fees (net of hacks), then the security team gets rewarded handsomely. If hacks eat away most or all of the fees to stakers, the security team responsible for that protocol makes far less. Once a relationship has been initiated with a protocol, the security team will work closely with the protocol’s developers to maintain and improve the security of the protocol as it changes over time.\n",
  "SHERX Token": "SHERX is essentially tokenized \"interest\" payments to stakers from protocols. Protocols can pay premiums to Sherlock in an assortment of tokens. Instead of paying interest to stakers in 20 different tokens, SHERX is essentially a \"packaged\" version of the 20 tokens being paid as interest.\n\nIt would be very gas-intensive to pay stakers in many different token types. As an alternative, the SHERX token was created to represent the many different token types paid by protocols. This way, stakers are transferred one token (SHERX) instead of 10 or 20 different tokens.\n\nImportant: SHERX will always be redeemable for its underlying collateral (the 10 or 20 different tokens) so it will always have intrinsic value.\n",
  "SHIBA Token": "A decentralized meme token that grew into a vibrant ecosystem. SHIB is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building. SHIB token is their first token and allows users to hold Billions or even Trillions of them. Nicknamed the DOGECOIN KILLER, this ERC-20 ONLY token can remain well under a penny and still outpace Dogecoin in a small amount of time (relatively speaking). Popular worldwide, and already up thousands of percent, Shiba token ($Shib) is the first cryptocurrency token to be listed and incentivized on ShibaSwap, their decentralized exchange.\n\nThe team locked the 50% of the total supply to Uniswap and threw away the keys. The remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and they were the first project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don't own team tokens they can dump on the community.\n",

  "Short": "A form of leverage that speculates the value of an asset will go down, and borrows the asset expected to fall in value, and swaps it for a more valuable asset so that a small portion of the relatively appreciated asset can be sold to repay the debt, and the difference is gain. If the value however goes up, the difference will be loss, and the gains or losses will be in proportion to the leverage taken out against the underlying collateral.\n",
  "Short Address Attack": "Short address attacks are a side-effect of the EVM itself accepting incorrectly padded arguments. Attackers can exploit this by using specially-crafted addresses to make poorly coded clients encode arguments incorrectly before including them in transactions. Is this an EVM issue or a client issue? Should it be fixed in smart contracts instead? While everyone has a different opinion, the fact is that a great deal of ether could be directly impacted by this issue. While this vulnerability has yet to be exploited in the wild, it is a good demonstration of problems arising from the interaction between clients and the Ethereum blockchain. Other off-chain issues exist: an important one is the Ethereum ecosystem's deep trust in specific Javascript front ends, browser plugins and public nodes. An infamous off-chain exploit was used in the hack of the Coindash ICO that modified the company's Ethereum address on their webpage to trick participants into sending ethers to the attacker's address.\n",

  "Shortfall Events": "The main role of the Aave Safety Module is to protect the protocol against unexpected loss of funds stemming from: (1) Smart contract risk: Risk of a bug, design flaw or potential attack surfaces on the smart contract layer; (2) Liquidation risk: Risk of failure of an asset that is being used as collateral on Aave; risk of liquidators not capturing liquidation opportunities in a timely manner, or low market liquidity of the principal asset to be repaid; and (3) Oracle failure risk: Risk of the Oracle system not properly updating the prices in case of extreme market downturn and network congestion; risk of the Oracle system not properly submitting prices, causing improper liquidations. In case of loss of capital, the SM uses up to 30% of the assets locked to cover the deficit. If the amount seized from the SM is not enough to cover the whole debt, an ad-hoc AAVE issuance event is triggered called Recovery Issuance. The issued AAVE are used, together with the amount drawn from the SM, to cover the deficit.\n",

In addition, Sifchain will support an on-chain governance process for developing additional pegged tokens for new blockchains as needed. Sifchain uses both an order book and a CLP for trade completion. Orders are placed with a commit-reveal scheme to circumvent front-running from validators. Committing a limit order will require traders to actually transfer the value posted, regardless of whether or not it is revealed. Sifchain derives its internal asset price from its CLPs. One CLP is used for trades directly involving Rowan, two CLPs are used for all other trades. For example, the USDC:BTC internal price is calculated using the USDC:ROWAN and ROWAN:BTC CLPs.\n",

  "Simple Agreement for Future Tokens ": "The commercial instrument used to convey rights in tokens prior to the development of the tokens’ functionality. In the U.S., the SAFT itself is a security, so it could be offered in a private placement to accredited investors. The tokens that are ultimately delivered to the investors, though, should be fully-functional, and therefore not securities under U.S. law. Outside of the U.S., the need to limit SAFTs or tokens to accredited investors will depend upon the laws of the local jurisdiction.\n",
  "Simple Logic Bugs": "Some of the above issues are more specific to smart contracts, others are common to all types of programming. However, by far the most common type of issue we detect consists of simple mistakes in the logic of the smart contract. These errors may the result of a simple typo, a misunderstanding of the specification, or a larger programming mistake. They tend to have severe implications on the security and functionality of the smart contract. What they all have in common though, is the fact that they can only be detected if the auditor understands the code base completely and has an insight into the project's intended functionality and the contract's specification. It is these types of issues that are the reason smart contract audits take time, are not cheap, and require highly experienced auditors.\n",
  "Simple Moving Average": "A technical indicator that can aid in determining if an asset price will continue or if it will reverse a bull or bear trend. It is calculated by using the average of a selected range of prices, usually closing prices, by the number of periods in that range. Short-term averages respond quickly to changes in the price of the underlying security, while long-term averages are slower to react. There are other types of moving averages, including the exponential moving average (EMA) and the weighted moving average (WMA).\n",

  "SirenSwap Automated Market Maker": "The Automated Market Maker (AMM) used by SirenSwap. It is designed to address issues observed in other prototypal and production-grade AMMs while preserving a mint + trade bonding curve approach. The issues it is designed to address are:\n\n Trading multiple markets from a single pool. AMM can trade multiple markets that share the same collateral and payment assets. For example, it can trade multiple strikes of WBTC calls.\n Passive LP participation. With AMM, liquidity providers (\"LPs\") don’t need to worry about rolling their liquidity to another pool at expiration. As long as the AMM has active markets, LPs can keep their deposits.\n Solving theta decay loss. Because the price is quoted using a Black-Scholes model, AMM is time-decay-aware.\n No arbitrage needed. There is no need for arbitrage in order to quote reasonable prices.\n\nSIREN uses on-chain Black-Scholes approximation coupled with a price Oracle (Chainlink). It uses the bonding curve to determine slippage for each trade, but not the starting price. You can think of it as if a pool is being dynamically created for each trade based on the current oracle price.\n",

  "Slippage": "The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed. Slippage can occur at any time but is most prevalent during periods of higher volatility when market orders are used. It can also occur when a large order is executed but there isn't enough volume at the chosen price to maintain the current bid/ask spread.\n\nSlippage does not denote a negative or positive movement because any difference between the intended execution price and actual execution price qualifies as slippage. When an order is executed, the security is purchased or sold at the most favorable price offered by an exchange or other market maker. This can produce results that are more favorable, equal to or less favorable than the intended execution price. The final execution price vs. intended execution price can be categorized as positive slippage, no slippage and/or negative slippage.\n",
  "Slippage Tolerance": "A setting for the limit of price slippage a user is willing to accept. By setting slippage tolerance, users basically set a limit on how many tokens they will accept, whether higher or lower than the rate shown in the interface. Slippage tolerance is set as a percentage of the total swap value. For instance, if users set slippage tolerance at 3%, it means that the amount of tokens that they will receive will not differ greater than by 3%.\n",
  "Small cap": "Cryptocurrency with a market cap smaller than 100 million USD.\n",
  "Smart Contract": "A piece of computer software that is designed as an automated self-enforcing contract, which means it triggers certain action after predetermined conditions are met. Smart contracts can be used, for instance, as digital agreements that intermediate the exchange of cryptocurrencies (or any other digital asset) between two parties. Once the terms of the agreement have been set, the smart contract verifies their fulfillment and the assets are distributed in accordance.\n\nIn other words, smart contracts are basically lines of code that execute a specific function once certain conditions are met. The code usually follows \"if... then...\" statements that trigger predetermined and predictable actions. \n\nFor example, an online shop may implement a smart contract that ensures that “if payment is received, then products are delivered” - which would make the whole process more efficient and less prone to human error.\n",
  "Smart Contract Audit": "A service offered by cybersecurity firms specializing in blockchain technology and decentralized applications. During such checks, experts look for vulnerabilities and bugs in the code that comprises a smart contract to ensure that there are no vulnerabilities. Such checks are complex, as smart contracts often interact with each other and any integrations with third-party systems can also result in making the system vulnerable. Because of this, the checks are often expanded to other smart contracts involved in any interactions, and even those that the ones it interacts with are interacting with. Such checks usually include both running tests and manual code analysis. Smart contracts often manage huge quantities of funds and a single bug or vulnerability can result in great losses. More precisely, the users and stakeholders of the decentralized application in question could lose all the assets that are part of the ecosystem.\n",

  "Snapshot (Term)": "Traditionally, the term snapshot refers to the ability to record the state of a computer system or storage device at a specific point in time. In cryptocurrencies, a snapshot is often describing the act of recording the state of a blockchain on a particular block height. In this case, the snapshot records the contents of the entire blockchain ledger, which includes all existing addresses and their associated data (transactions, fees, balance, metadata, and so on).\n\nSnapshots are commonly used during airdrops events before each round takes place. During an airdrop, tokens are distributed based on the balance of each blockchain address. In this case, snapshots are taken to record the balance of each token holder, at a specific point in time (i.e., block height). In most cases, users can move their funds after the snapshot is taken, without compromising their eligibility to participate in that round of distribution.\n",

  "Soft Fork ": "In blockchain technology, a soft fork is a change to the software protocol where only previously valid transaction blocks are made invalid. Because old nodes will recognize the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backwards-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules, as opposed to a hard fork that requires all nodes to upgrade and agree on the new version.\n\nSoft forks don't require any nodes to upgrade to maintain consensus, since all blocks with the new soft forked-in rules also follow the old rules, therefore old clients accept them. Soft forks cannot be reversed without a hard fork since a soft fork by definition only allows the set of valid blocks to be a proper subset of what was valid pre-fork. If users upgrade to a post-soft fork client and for some reason a majority of miners switch back to the pre-soft fork client, the post-soft fork client users would break consensus as soon as a block came along that didn't follow their clients' new rules. In order for a soft fork to work, a majority of the mining power needs to be running a client recognizing the fork. The more miners that accept the new rules, the more secure the network is post-fork. If you have 3/4 of miners recognizing the fork, 1/4 blocks created aren't guaranteed to follow the new rules. These 1/4 blocks will be valid to old nodes that aren't aware of the new rules, but they will be ignored by new nodes.\n",

  "Solidity Abi Encoder v2 Bug": "The Contract ABI is a specification how data can be exchanged with contracts from the outside (a Dapp) or when interacting between contracts. It supports a variety of types of data, including simple values like numbers, bytes and strings, as well as more complex data types, including arrays and structs. When a contract receives input data, it must decode that (this is done by the \"ABI decoder\") and prior to returning data or sending data to another contract, it must encode it (this is done by the \"ABI encoder\"). The Solidity compiler generates these two pieces of code for each defined function in a contract (and also for abi.encode and abi.decode). In the Solidity compiler the subsystem generating the encoder and decoder is called the \"ABI encoder\". In mid-2017 the Solidity team started to work on a fresh implementation named \"ABI encoder V2\" with the goal of having a more flexible, safe, performant and auditable code generator. This experimental code generator, when explicitly enabled, has been offered to users since the end of 2017 with the 0.4.19 release. The experimental ABI encoder does not handle non-integer values shorter than 32 bytes properly. This applies to bytesNN types, bool, enum and other types when they are part of an array or a struct and encoded directly from storage. This means these storage references have to be used directly inside abi.encode(...), as arguments in external function calls or in event data without prior assignment to a local variable. Using return does not trigger the bug. The types bytesNN and bool will result in corrupted data while enum might lead to an invalid revert. Furthermore, arrays with elements shorter than 32 bytes may not be handled correctly even if the base type is an integer type. Encoding such arrays in the way described above can lead to other data in the encoding being overwritten if the number of elements encoded is not a multiple of the number of elements that fit a single slot. If nothing follows the array in the encoding (note that dynamically-sized arrays are always encoded after statically-sized arrays with statically-sized content), or if only a single array is encoded, no other data is overwritten.\n",

They have seen recently that centralized platforms designed to \"democratise finance\" just cannot be trusted - as Robinhood's response to the trading of GME on their platform demonstrated. The only way to ensure that everyone has access to top-end investment strategies and tools is to democratise the system. Crypto allows us to do that - but it's not easy to play at a level where you can use those top-end investment strategies and tools. But some people can do it. With Solrise, investors can put their funds in the hands of bold, creative, and market-leading traders from all across the world. Solrise is a fully decentralized and non-custodial protocol for investment funds on Solana. What this means in practice is that anyone can open a fund, and anyone can invest in it. Their platform allows fund managers from all across the globe - whether they be well-established and looking for a new channel, or ambitious rookies with something to prove - to open a fund, with performance kept completely transparent. Existing decentralized fund management platforms on Ethereum are suffering from brutally high transaction fees. With Solrise, they can create, enter, and exit funds all for under $0.01.\n",

  "Source Code": "A collection of lines of computer code, which are responsible for defining how a program (software) will function based on a list of deterministic instructions and statements. In essence, source code is the primary state of a software at the moment it is originally written.\n\nAs such, a source code consists of a set of instructions that can be written on various different computer programming languages, such as Java, JavaScript, C, Python, PHP, Go, Rusty, Solidity, and Haskell. All these programming languages have a common characteristic: they consist of a set of instructions for computers to follow in order to perform certain actions and produce particular outputs.\n\nAfter being created the source code is often \"translated\" or compiled into a machine language that computers are able to understand and execute. In some situations, however, the source code is executed right away without the need for compilation (these computer programs are known as interpreters).\n",
  "SourceCred": "A technology that makes the labor of individuals more visible and rewardable as they work together in a project or community. The goal of SourceCred is to use this technology to make rewarding labor as nuanced as human contribution often is. We hope to be one piece in the puzzle of a healthier future where systems serve community members, where financial maximization isn't the end-all be-all goal, and where wealth actually flows to those who are creating the value in our world. SourceCred uses an algorithm to determine how much value a contribution or contributor added to a project overall. When a contribution is made to a project, SourceCred's purpose is to \"see\" that contribution and assign it an amount of \"Cred\" based on how much value it brought to the project as a whole. That Cred flows from the contribution to all the people and other contributions that supported it. In this way, you can imagine how a project could be represented as a \"node graph\" made up of contribution and people dots (aka \"nodes\") connected by lines (aka \"edges\") that flow Cred around to the nodes based on what supported what. The more edges one contribution has to other important contributions in the project, the more Cred is going to have an opportunity to flow to it along the edges. In this way, it's easy to tell by the Cred score which contributions (and contributors) are truly foundational and support future work in the project.\n",
  "Sourcify": "An initiative which aims to make interacting with smart contracts on the blockchain safer and more transparent for users. To achieve this goal, Sourcify supports several efforts to foster adoption of open-source source verification, metadata files and NatSpec comments.

Sourcify basically provides the base layer, which allows other tools to be built on top of it. Its main purpose is to keep metadata and source files available via IPFS and Swarm (preventing that the links in the bytecode turn into dead links). Besides the technical infrastructure, Sourcify is also a collective movement to bring transparency and awareness to the space. We try to educate and build bridges between development tools, wallets, interfaces and other components which all play an important role in demystifying interaction with smart contracts for the end user and hence making blockchain interactions safer.\n",

  "Spent Output Profit Ratio": "An indicator that acts as a proxy for overall market profit and loss. It represents the profit ratio of coins moved on-chain, measured through the variation between purchase price and sale price. A SOPR value of greater than 1 implies that people are, on average, selling at a profit (because the price sold is greater than the price paid). Likewise when SOPR is below 1, this implies that people would be selling at a loss. Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) is calculated by dividing the realized value of a spent output (in USD) by the value at creation of the original UTXO (in USD).

Recently, this type of digital currencies has grown in popularity, and the crypto space now have numerous stablecoin projects. Although the exact mechanisms vary from one coin to another, stablecoins are supposed to be somewhat resistant to market volatility, so they should not experience significant price changes. Many stablecoins have their values fixed by pegging them to the price of another asset. While most of them are pegged to the US dollar, there are stablecoins pegged to the price of other cryptocurrencies, or even commodities, like silver or gold. By being pegged to real-world assets, these coins avoid the wild price swings caused by the high levels of volatility, very common in cryptocurrency markets.\n",

  "StaFi Protocol": "The first decentralized protocol unlocking liquidity of Staked assets. StaFi aims to solve the contradiction between Mainnet security and token liquidity in PoS consensus. The token holders are staking through staking contracts built in StaFi protocol, and then get alternative tokens(rToken ,such as rXTZ, rAtom, rDot, etc.). rTokens are tradable and it can get staking rewards from the original chain concurrently. StaFi is a combined abbreviation of Staking + Finance. It is a decentralized protocol built with the Substrate. The contract layer is composed of multiple staking contracts, and the application layer is mainly trading platform of rTokens.\n",

Every strategy has a carefully weighted risk score, enabling everyone to participate on their own terms and risk appetites. From strategies based on stablecoins to Bitcoin and a comprehensive range of ERC-20 tokens, their platform has everything users need to secure higher returns on their crypto.\n",
  "Stake DAO Token": "The token of Stake DAO, earned by users who deposit their tokens into the DAO. After a set duration, Stake DAO Tokens (SDTs) are disbursed to all users in proportion to the amount of fees that their deposit generated for the DAO. SDT holders can then stake their earned SDT to receive a share of the DAO fees. Claiming rewards requires no action from the user.\n\nThe SDT token will also provide governance rights to the holder. SDT holders will then be able to vote on topics such as adding a new token to the DAO or changing token distribution rates, or they can use their SDT to open a new vote, and propose other changes to the DAO. By giving both DAO staking rewards and governance rights to SDT stakers, the DAO aims to turn all users into active Stake DAO stakeholders. This system not only rewards early adopters with more voting power, it also rewards collective long-term thinking and aligns the incentives between SDT holders and the Stake DAO protocol beyond a simple service provider relationship.\n\nLiquidity providers or anyone who receives SDT may choose to sell their SDT token to buyers who wish to use it in order to receive cashback. Since the active supply of SDT token is always increasing due to investors receiving freshly minted SDT, the share of inactive SDT holders will continually be diluted. Therefore, SDT holders have a strong incentive to also become Stake DAO service investors in order to avoid dilution.\n",
  "Staked": "A firm that helps institutional investors reliably and securely compound their crypto assets by 5% - 100% annually via staking and lending.

  "Staking": "The process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain. On these blockchains, anyone with a minimum-required balance of a specific cryptocurrency can validate transactions and earn Staking rewards. When the minimum balance is met, a node deposits that amount of cryptocurrency into the network as a stake (similar to a security deposit). The size of a stake is directly proportional to the chances of that node being chosen to forge the next block. If the node successfully creates a block, the validator receives a reward, similar to how a miner is rewarded in proof-of-work chains. Validators lose part of their stake if they double-sign or attempt to attack the network.\n",
  "Staking Facilities": "A validator, node operator, and service provider in Web 3.0. They operate industry-grade, highly secure physical infrastructure for next-generation blockchains to run on. They offer non-custodial staking services for Proof-of-Stake token holders and provide essential services for the Web 3.0 ecosystem. They promise high security, compliance efforts, aligned incentives, and community contributions.\n",
  "Staking Pool": "A staking pool allows multiple stakeholders (or bagholders) to combine their computational resources as a way to increase their chances of being rewarded. In other words, they unite their staking power in the process of verifying and validating new blocks, so they have a higher probability of earning the block rewards. \n\nThe overall idea of the staking pool model is quite similar to the traditional mining pool, which involves the pooling of hash rate in a Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain. However, the staking pool setup is only available on blockchains that employ the Proof of Stake (PoS) model or, in non-POS systems through protocol design features.\n\nTypically, a staking pool is managed by a pool operator and the stakeholders that decide to join the pool have to lock their coins in a specific blockchain address (or wallet). While some pools require users to stake their coins with a third party, there are many other alternatives that allow stakeholders to contribute with their staking power while still holding their coins in a personal wallet. For instance, the so-called cold staking pools enable a more secure model, as users can participate in the staking process while keeping their funds on a hardware wallet.\n",
  "Staking-as-a-Service": "Staking-as-a-Service platforms enable crypto investors to stake their stakable PoS digital assets via a third-party service that takes care of the technical aspect of the staking process. For this service, platforms charge a fee – usually a percentage of the staking rewards.\n",
  "Stale Block": "A block which was successfully mined but not included on the current longest blockchain, usually because another block at the same height was added to the chain first.\n",
  "Standard Tokenization Protocol": "An open-source standard defining how tokenized assets are issued and transferred while complying with all necessary regulations. Tokens built on top of the STP-Standard will use the protocol's on-chain Validator to verify compliance with any jurisdictional or issuer-specific requirements. Standard Tokenization Protocol allows assets to be tokenized in a way that makes them fully compliant across jurisdictions and transferable across any blockchain platform.\n",

Stargaze generates UCI via inflation funding from a proof-of-stake blockchain and doesn't have to rely on advertising for revenue.\n\nContent on Stargaze are NFTs owned by the users. Users have authority to do whatever they want with their content, and aren't beholden to any authority or platform.\n\nIncome users earn from creating and curating content on Stargaze flow into their creator coin. This makes Stargaze creator coins reflect the social capital and content creation and curation abilities of users, and have value beyond just speculative trading.\n\nFurthermore, Stargaze integrates into third party web 2.0 social platforms via oracles, allowing Stargaze creator coins to accrue value from users' actions on those platforms as well.\n\nThe protocol is built as a sovereign blockchain with Cosmos SDK. This allows Stargaze to have very low gas fees (< $0.01), have high performance (5 second block times), and have it's own block space without having to compete with other DeFi protocols. It also enables a large decentralized validator set, and interoperability with the Cosmos ecosystem, Ethereum, Ethereum Layer 2s, Bitcoin, Solana, and others via IBC (Inter-blockchain communication), a TCP/IP-like protocol that enables blockchains to communicate.\n",

  "STARS Token": "Native token of Stargaze. STARS is a staking token with mint and burn mechanics. STARS has dynamic emission and no supply cap. Inflation is used to incentivize staking participation in the network, and varies between 7% and 20% based on how much is staked. It is inversely proportional to the staked amount. As the staked to total supply ratio falls below 67%, inflation increases, and vice versa. On each block, 45% inflation goes to validators, 5% to the DAO (community pool), and 50% to reward pools that hold UCI payouts.\n\nStargaze has two token burn mechanisms.\n\n1. Whenever a native post is created on Stargaze, half the storage cost is burned while the other half goes to the block proposer as payment for storage. Storage cost is based on a specific amount of STARS per byte, as determined by governance. Therefore, the value of STARS increases as more content is posted to the blockchain.\n2. Whenever a native post (NFT) is purchased, a 10% fee is charged and burned.\n\nSTARS is used for various purposes in Stargaze:\n\n1. STARS are used for creator coin purchases.\n2. STARS are used for purchasing NFTs.\n3. STARS are used to \"boost\" content on Stargaze by increasing the curation period.\n4. STARS are required for storage payments.\n5. STARS are used in governance (i.e: for putting deposits up for proposals).\n6. STARS are used for gas fees.\n7. STARS are used for validating the network.\n",

  "State Channels": "The process in which users transact with one another directly outside of the blockchain, or ‘off-chain,’ and greatly minimize their use of ‘on-chain’ operations. It is one among many methods to scale [Ethereum](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recHnQzGJpRxx1FFd). They are very similar in concept to the payment channels in Bitcoin’s Lightning Network, but instead of only supporting payments, they also support general ‘state updates.’ On-chain transactions aren’t completely eliminated but rather reduced to only the necessary sequences. Users have to create and pay for an Ethereum transaction when they first open up the channel. When they’re ready to close the channel, they again have to pay fees to process a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. Cutting the number of necessary on-chain transactions down to two drastically reduces the costs and increase the speed associated with using Ethereum.\n",
  "State Guardian Network": "An efficient and scalable sidechain in the Celer Network that offers highly reliable and decentralized services to eliminate the state channel security risks and usability hassles caused by the off-chain availability problem.

Below we summarize the roles and responsibilities of each component: (1) Mainchain contracts hold the CELR staking process. They specify and enforce the fundamental rules and configurations of roles, rewards, penalties, and fees for all network participants; (2) Delegators stake their CELR tokens on the mainchain contract to vote on validators and governance proposals. Delegators receive their shares of SGN block rewards and service fees proportional to their stakes; (3) Validators are elected by the delegators on the mainchain contract. They run sidechains under BFT consensus to offer SGN services, calculate reward distributions, and trigger penalty executions. Validators receive commission rewards from their delegators; and (4) Users are state channel clients who pay service fees to the mainchain contract and submit service requests to the sidechain.\n",

It is important to note that unlike Unrealized Loss, Supply in Loss does not account for the amount of loss - only the binary case of whether or not the coin is in loss.\n\nSupply in Loss is calculated by determining which coins were last moved when the price was higher than the current price (i.e. the price has decreased since the coins were last moved). It represents the total absolute number of those coins.\n\nIntroduced by Glassnode in November 2019.\n",
  "Supply in Profit": "Metric that represents the absolute amount of coins in a given network which are currently in profit (i.e. the price at the time they were last moved is lower than the current price). This metric is helpful in highlighting market tops by suggesting when investors might be close to taking profits. It is important to note that unlike Unrealized Profit, Supply in Profit does not account for the amount of profit - only the binary case of whether or not the coin is in profit.\n\nSupply in Profit is calculated by determining which coins were last moved when the price was lower than the current price (i.e. the price has increased since the coins were last moved). It represents the total absolute number of those coins.\n\nIntroduced by Glassnode in November 2019.\n",
  "Supply-Adjusted Coin Days Destroyed": "Metric that accounts for the impact that coin day accumulation by the total supply has on the Coin Days Destroyed metric. As more coins are issued and more coin days are accumulated by the aggregate network, the lower bound of coin days destroyed will increase over time. This results in a steadily rising 'floor value' for CDD which therefore requires additional consideration in analysis to accurately compare measurements from different points in time. Adjusting for supply aims to provide a more proportional and equivalent view of indicator values over the history of the market.\n\nThe rationale behind supply adjustment is as follows:\n Early in a protocol's life, coin supply is small and so is the aggregate accumulated lifespan and thus the required adjustment is larger to scale up in line with more recent values.\n Later in a protocol's life, coin supply is larger and so is the aggregate accumulated lifespan so the required adjustment is smaller relative to recent values.\n\nIn general, horizontal levels and values in supply adjusted metrics are likely to more consistent over time than those for the base metric. The trends, fractals and interpretation remain consistent between both the original metric and supply adjusted variants.\n",
  "Supply-Adjusted Dormancy": "Metric that accounts for the impact that coin day accumulation by the total supply has on the Average Coin Dormancy metric. As more coins are issued and more coin days are accumulated by the aggregate network, the lower bound of coin days destroyed and thus Dormancy will increase over time.\n\nThis results in a steadily rising 'floor value' for Dormancy which therefore requires additional consideration in analysis to accurately compare measurements from different points in time.

  "Support": "Support, or a support level, refers to the price level that an asset does not fall below for period of time. An asset's support level is created by buyers entering the market whenever the asset dips to a lower price. In technical analysis, the simple support level can be charted by drawing a line along the lowest lows for the time period being considered. The support line can be flat or slanted up or down with the overall price trend. Other technical indicators and charting techniques can be used to identify more advanced versions of support.\n",

The project has two distinct phases, and is currently in Phase 2. \n\nPhase 2: Reward the Hodlers - Phase 2 started the moment Phase 1 ended, when the max supply of 10 million SURF was hit. The fixed APY beaches closed, the Whirlpool activated, and all of its accrued SURF started getting paid out to those staking their ETH/SURF Uniswap LP tokens. Phase 2 also introduced the first of many projects launching within the SURF ecosystem that will continually pay dividends to everyone staked in the Whirlpool. As a fairly distributed governance token, SURF will be controlled by those that value it the most. All of the most impactful parameters in the protocol can be adjusted through successful governance proposals, ensuring that the community of SURF hodlers can continually experiment and improve it.\n\n",

The Suterusu protocol is based on their original ZK-ConSNARK technology, which strikes a perfect balance between performance and security.\n\nThe user can register a new Suter account by inputting a random private key. The corresponding public key is the identifier of the newly created Suter account. The user invokes the fund module and converts ETH or ERC-20 to Suter-ETH or Suter-ERC-20 token. The converted token will be added to the new account using homomorphic public-key encryption. The native token will be sent to the fund contract, which would be like a stream of water entering an ocean. The user can then select a receiver Suter account to send the converted token. This receiver Suter account can be either generated by himself or sent from the others. The transfer of the converted token will be anonymous and confidential since we will invoke the ZK-ConSNARK technique to guarantee the Suter account anonymity and the confidentiality of the transferred amount. The user can then invoke the burn module and convert the Suter-token back to its original form. As long as the user uses a different Ethereum account to invoke this module from the fund module, the connection between the funded token and the burned token is severed.\n",

  "Synthereum": "Product of Jarvis Network. Synthereum is a platform for on-chain trading. Users include those who buy, sell, or exchange synthetic assets against liquidity providers, or borrow synthetic assets from the protocol.\n",
  "Synthetic Assets": "In the Synthetix ecosystem, Synthetic assets or “Synths” copy the price of an asset in the “real world” and brings it onto the [Ethereum](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recHnQzGJpRxx1FFd) blockchain giving that Synth all the properties of an ERC20 token. They allow holders to gain exposure on Ethereum to various asset classes without holding the underlying assets themselves or trusting a custodian. Synths are backed by the Synthetix Network Token (SNX). There are currently five categories of Synths available: fiat currencies, commodities, cryptocurrencies, inverse cryptocurrencies, and cryptocurrency indexes. Fiat Synths include sUSD, sEUR, sKRW, and many more; commodity Synths include synthetic gold and synthetic silver, both measured per ounce; cryptocurrencies include sBTC, sETH, and sBNB, with more to come; and Inverse Synths inversely track the price of those available cryptocurrencies, meaning that when BTC’s price decreases, iBTC’s price increases. The current cryptocurrency indexes are sDEFI and sCEX (and their inverses), which respectively track a basket of DeFi assets and a basket of centralised exchange tokens.\n",
  "Synthetic Ether": "Synthetic token from Synthetix. It is a soft peg of standard ether (ETH), designed to stay as close in value as possible. In the early days, however, sETH has often traded at a discount, making it difficult for traders to move seamlessly between the collateralized and synthetic worlds without incurring high costs.\n\nUniswap's constant product model forces the price of sETH lower when the demand for ETH is higher. However, the larger the ETH/sETH liquidity pool grows, the less impact any one trade has. As such, Synthetix encourages investors to add liquidity to the pool by offering SNX incentives. Synthetix hopes that the combination of these rewards and the Arbitrage Pool incentives will bolster a strong peg.\n",
  "Synthetic Tokens": "Tokens that are similar to traditional synthetic assets. They both allow people to bet on the price of an asset without holding the actual asset. However, synthetic tokens utilize collateral and liquidation to synthesize targeted yield curves while the traditional synthetic assets have to hold various financial products to do so.\n",
  "Synthetic USD": "Synthetic USD (sUSD) is Synthetix native stablecoin. sUSD is used to trade Synths on the Synthetix Exchange and is minted through SNX staking.\n",
  "Synthetify": "An upcoming synthetic assets platform, fully built on the Solana blockchain. The platform aims to provide a bridge between cryptocurrencies, stocks, fiat currencies and other financial instruments directly from one decentralized exchange. Synthetify solves critical problems seen on other Synthetic assets platforms, like high fees, long confirmation times and losses caused by arbitrage during sharp market moves. The Solana blockchain offers orders of magnitude better performance than any other layer one blockchain available on the market right now and thanks to low fees and fast confirmation time it's a perfect bedrock for applications like Synthetify. Synthetify will introduce its own token that will act as collateral for synthetic assets, reduce fees on Synthetify and hold voting power during governance decisions.\n",
  "Synthetify Token": "Native token of Synthetify. Synthetify (SNY) is anticipated to hold the following utility: (1) Collateral for creation of synthetic assets on Synthetify, (2) Discount for performing swaps on Synthetify, and (3) in the future SNY will represent vote in governance decisions. Synthetify plans to supply 100,000,000 SNY tokens.\n",
  "Synthetix": "A decentralized synthetic asset issuance protocol built on Ethereum. These synthetic assets are collateralized by the Synthetix Network Token (SNX) which when locked in the contract enables the issuance of synthetic assets (Synths). This pooled collateral model enables users to perform conversions between Synths directly with the smart contract, avoiding the need for counterparties. This mechanism solves the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by DEX’s. The protocol currently supports synthetic fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies (long and short) and commodities. SNX holders are incentivised to stake their tokens as they are paid a pro-rata portion of the fees generated through activity on Synthetix Exchange, based on their contribution to the network. It is the right to participate in the network and capture fees generated from Synth exchanges, from which the value of the SNX token is derived. Trading on Synthetix Exchange does not require the trader to hold SNX. SNX stakers incur a ‘debt’ when they mint Synths. This debt can increase or decrease independent of their original minted value, based on the exchange rates and supply of Synths within the network. For example, if 100% of the Synths in the system were synthetic Bitcoin (sBTC), which halved in price, the debt in the system would halve, and each staker’s debt would also halve. This means in another scenario, where only half the Synths across the system were sBTC, and BTC doubled in price, the system’s total debt—and each staker’s debt—would increase by one quarter. In this way, SNX stakers act as a pooled counterparty to all Synth exchanges; stakers take on the risk of the overall debt in the system. They have the option of hedging this risk by taking positions external to the system. By incurring this risk and enabling trading on Synthetix Exchange stakers earn a right to fees generated by the system.\n",
  "Synthetix Network Token": "The primary form of collateral backing the synthetic assets available in the Synthetix protocol. Its stakers are entitled to fees generated by Synth trades on Synthetix Exchange. The value of SNX is thus directly connected with the usage of the network it collateralises. This mechanism allows Synthetix to support instantaneous, near-frictionless conversion between different flavours of Synths without the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by other decentralised exchanges.\n",

Tendermint consists of two chief technical components: a blockchain consensus engine and a generic application interface. The consensus engine, called Tendermint Core, ensures that the same transactions are recorded on every machine in the same order. The application interface, called the Application BlockChain Interface (ABCI), enables the transactions to be processed in any programming language. Unlike other blockchain and consensus solutions, which come pre-packaged with built in state machines (like a fancy key-value store, or a quirky scripting language), developers can use Tendermint for BFT state machine replication of applications written in whatever programming language and development environment is right for them.

Once the book is scanned and checked in again, the rental contract will self destruct and the book will be available to check out from the library again. Readers can also contribute books to the library by adding a supported RFID tag and scanning the book into the library. They will receive all fees generated by the book. Unlike the original Little Free Library project, this incentives the sharing of higher quality books that will generate revenue for the contributor.\n",
  "The Oracle Problem": "The Oracle Problem is that there are no currently successful decentralized designs. Therefore, all currently functioning oracles are centralized and introduce a series of attack vectors & issues including:\n\n Accuracy – even without malice, a centralized entity is often mistaken about the status or value of something. This prevents an oracle from providing the “real” answer to be memorialized on the blockchain.\n Gaming – many oracles are critical for the functioning of smart contracts holding significant amounts of assets. If an attacker can trick the oracle into changing its value then it becomes quite simple to steal assets.\n Consistency – the most desired oracles are information streams, where the values change constantly. This means users expect oracles to accurately and consistently provide information on a certain schedule (often every block). However, there is no guarantee that a transaction (to post the information) will be certain to enter a block, no matter the fee that is paid. This is both a usability issue and an attack vector.\n\nSolutions to the oracle problem center around ways to both validate the data being queried and also place this data on chain in both an available and non-centralized manner. The solutions come in two forms. One is to make your centralized oracles better and the second is to make your oracles decentralized.\n",

  "Theta": "The term theta refers to the rate of daily decline in the option value due to the passage of time. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to the expiration date, as long as everything is held constant. Buyer’s side calls and puts have negative theta and, all other things being equal, lose money as time passes. Writer’s side calls and puts have positive theta and, all other things being equal, make money as time passes.\n\nThe theta of options is indirectly proportional to gamma. When gamma is big and positive, theta tends to be big and negative. A position that has a lot of gamma (good for fast changing underlying assets) also has lots of theta that is continuously eroding its value. Theta is highest for the ATM strike and slopes off to the ITM and OTM options, and it responds to the passage of time and changes in volatility the same way that gamma does.\n",
  "Theta Fuel": "The 2nd token in the Theta protocol that works in conjunction with the Theta Token (THETA) that exists today. Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is an operational token. It powers on-chain operations like payments to relayers for sharing a video stream, or for deploying or interacting with smart contracts.

  "Theta Token": "Native token of Theta Network. To encourage viewers to contribute their computing and bandwidth resources, the team introduce the token as an incentive mechanism. Caching nodes can earn tokens as they relay video streams to other viewers. Not only does the Theta Token motivate viewers to join the network as caching nodes, it also greatly improves the streaming market efficiency by streamlining the video delivery process. Within the Theta Network, advertisers can also directly target viewers at a lower cost, viewers earn Theta Tokens for their attention and engagement with their favorite content, and influencers earn Theta Token as gifts directly from viewers. More interestingly, streaming and content platforms can open up new and incremental revenue opportunities with Theta. It is also the governance token of the Theta protocol. THETA is used to stake as a Validator or Guardian node, contributing to block production and the protocol governance of the Theta Network. By staking and running a node, users will earn a proportional amount of the new TFUEL generated. The supply of THETA is fixed at 1 billion and will never increase.\n",

  "Threshold Signatures": "A cryptographic scheme where an arbitrary group of signers can construct one signature, as long as there are sufficiently many of them. This enables a huge efficiency gain, because almost all the calculation can be done by the signers before submitting to Ethereum, and what they actually end up submitting is very concise. Chainlink's current best threshold signature scheme requires about 15k gas to confirm. This means, for instance, that the $3,000 data point would only cost about $2, a 1,500-fold savings.\n",
  "Thrive Labs": "A Block-chain based Marketplace to buy and sell advertising at very low fees. They provide premium inventories, analytics tools, self-service tools and managed services to ensure the results you deserve.\n",
  "Tick Spacing": "The distribution of liquidity into ticks is the core innovation of Uniswap V3 and is the basis of all the other innovations. A tick spacing is a measure of difference in price between the minimum upward or downward movement of the price of a token on an exchange.This spacing of the price is where liquidity providers can trade and provide their funds to the pool as market makers. Ticks are the representation of the list of different prices at which the liquidity in the pool is available. Prices in the liquidity pool are always expressed in reference of one token against the other token in the pool. These are presented as percentages of price. For instance, the standard Uniswap v3 pool offers a 1 percent tick spacing.\n\nA lower and upper tick together are called a Range. And a liquidity provider can place their liquidity on the Uniswap automated market maker using any number of ranges to express their preference for prices of the tokens. These ranges are also known as a Range Order.\n\nIf Alice wants to make as much profit as possible on UniswapV3, she can now set her price for exchanging stablecoin tokens in a narrow range such one between $0.99 and $1.01. The 0.99 price is the lower tick and the $1.01 price is her upper tick. The range in which she places her tick is her Range Order.\n",
  "Ticker Symbol": "An arrangement of characters—usually letters—representing particular securities listed on an exchange or otherwise traded publicly. When a company issues securities to the public marketplace, it selects an available ticker symbol for its securities that investors and traders use to transact orders. Every listed security has a unique ticker symbol, facilitating the vast array of trade orders that flow through the financial markets every day.\n",
  "Time Bandit Attacks": "An attack in which miners rewrite blockchain history to steal funds allocated by smart contracts in the past. This happens in high Miner Extractable Value (MEV) regimes. Time bandit attacks' existence implies that DEXes and many other contracts are inherent threats to the stability of PoW blockchains, and the larger they grow, the bigger the threat.\n\nTime-bandit attacks are conceptually simple. Suppose a blockchain has a suffix (subchain) [height0, height1], with current block height height1, in which stealable value exceeds block rewards. An adversary can rewind to height0 and use the resulting MEV to subsidize a profitable 51% attack that mines a fork up to or past height1. Of course, a time-bandit attack relies on real-time access to massive mining resources. However, “rental attacks” are feasible using cloud resources, particularly for systems such as Ethereum that rely heavily on GPUs, which are standard cloud commodities. Sites such as http://crypto51.app/ estimate the costs of attack.\n",
  "Time-weighted average liquidity": "Time-weighted average liquidity shows which pool will have the most reliable time-weighted average price. It is a unique feature of Uniswap v3. It helps liquidity providers to get an idea about the liquidity of that pool, so it is a liquidity accumulator that tracks the liquidity of the pool. It is tracked alongside the price accumulator. It helps to evaluate which fee-tier pool can be used for trading.\n\nIf Bob starts trading using Uniswap v3, he’ll get the help of the platform to find a pool or smart contract with funds that have the best and most stable price for the exchange Bob wants to do, either buying or selling tokens.\n",
  "Time-weighted average price": "Time-weighted average price (TWAP) is the average price of a token over a time period. It is a trading indicator that shows the average price of a token at a given time. To understand the price of a token, a trader checks the opening, closing, highest and lowest price of a token at a given time. To get the TWAP, the trader takes the average of the price. The main purpose of TWAP is to understand the price. It indicates the trend of the market. It allows traders to compare the prices of tokens. It helps liquidity providers to make strategies and take decisions. With the help of TWAP, traders can decide to enter and exit the market.\n",
  "Timelock": "A condition for a transaction to only be processed at a certain time or block on the blockchain. Also known as locktime.\n",
  "Timestamp": "A form of identification for when a certain transaction occurred, usually with date and time of day and accurate to fractions of a second.\n",

Built on Plasma, TimeX matches orders off-chain for speed and privacy, while settling transactions on the blockchain technology for ultimate trust.\n",
  "Tipset": "A term mostly used to describe the blockchain of decentralized storage system Filecoin. Filecoin's consensus mechanism is built on tipsets, as their Expected Consensus system (unlike Bitcoin) is election-based and allows for multiple miners to be the elected leaders in a round. This means that Filecoin (or another similar storage system) allows more than one storage miner to create blocks in one epoch, which in turn increases the network throughput. Basing a blockchain on tipsets can also contribute to the security of the network: simply put, since each tipset's weight is relative to the amount of storage it provides, any node that attempts to disrupt the creation of valid blocks must contend against the consensus' preference for heavier chains. Filecoin's tipset system is similar to Ethereum, since the system motivates participants to collaborate and prevents work being wasted through an increase in chain throughput. The advantages of using a tipset system are that miners will gather together to support the heaviest chain, or the chain that is creating value — this is because decentralized storage systems naturally prioritize chains that are offering more storage. Tipsets that are lighter chains become orphan blocks, since they don't have the draw of greater storage power.\n",
  "Titan": "A blockchain based decentralized financial center that provides optimal liquidity solutions for different digital asset category by adaptive bonding curve. It not only provides a user-centered decentralized exchange, but also it is an aggregated liquidity pool that supports order smart routing.\n",

  "Token Curated Registries": "Registries of listings generated by token holders. Listings can be anything from names to hashes of full-blown records stored in IPFS. A holder stakes a portion of tokens to perform an action, i.e. adding a listing. Token holders can vote on whether to accept or reject the action using their tokens. A majority wins the vote and the action is accepted or rejected. The list is updated and should become more valuable given the improved listings and the fact that the staked tokens are now out of circulation.\n\nToken holders, acting in their own self-interest, will produce a valuable list by obtaining and staking a finite supply token. The more listings staked, the scarcer the tokens; the more valuable the list, the more valuable the tokens.\n",

It is a methodology that goes all the way from ideation to design, modelling, simulation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It's the process of building cryptoeconomic systems that work, and keep working. Just like other public infrastructure like bridges and power grids, our future economic systems also need to be rigorously designed to be reliable under widely varying conditions. The goal of token engineering is to design and create tokeneconomic systems that are robust against exploits, unintended consequences and cascade failures, in order to protect and empower users.\n",
  "Token Generation Event": "An event where a DApp developer/company publicly releases their tokens out into the market. These tokens tend to be from companies working in the utility space. Because these types of tokens are essentially tiny slices of a product, the creators typically refer to the token sales as token generation events or TGEs as opposed to ICOs. As the market matures, there has been an increased focus from regulatory authorities to rule ICOs as a security, and thus be liable to tax. Token Generation Events are aligned in such a way as to not be securities, so as to not incur a tax penalty.\n",
  "Token God Mode": "A dashboard produced by Nansen. It will allow users to input the address of any token.

The number of depositors, represented in yellow, refers to the number of wallets depositing the token in the exchange. The number of withdrawers, represented in turquoise, refers to the number of wallets withdrawing from the exchange. Depending on the volume of deposits relative to the volume of withdrawals, balance changes can either be positive or negative.\n\nUnder notable wallets, users can view balance changes within the last 7 days. By default, this chart is sorted from the greatest to least volume of balance changes. This next chart shows top transactions within the last 7 days sorted with the greatest number of transactions up top. Their top balances chart ranks wallets with the highest balance for this token. Under Top Holders: Balances, users can see a colorful graph showing changes in token balances for the top token holders.\n\nUnder Hodlers, the token seniority distribution graph shows when different addresses and tokens received their first token.

The team believes that both blockchains and decentralized applications (blockchain-based applications) are conceptually similar to traditional marketplace companies. They are Internet-native marketplaces whose, often fully digital, services generate revenue that's split between the projects' users (supply-side participants) and owners (tokenholders). These businesses are owned and operated by their tokenholders, similar to how companies are owned and operated by their shareholders. In some instances, the revenues can be directed to only one side, as is currently the case with projects like Uniswap and Ethereum, where the supply-side participants (liquidity providers and miners, respectively) earn all of the revenue generated. It is worth noting that a majority of current crypto projects are venture-backed and still record their costs and expenses off-chain (exceptions like Yearn do exist though), which is why the team initially decided to focus primarily on revenues instead of earnings. Once more projects start recording their costs and expenses on-chain, they will be able to provide accurate price to earnings ratios (P/E) as well.\n",

  "TON Token": "The native token of Tokamak Network which acts like Ether within the Etheruem ecosystem. TON has 18 decimal points and the lowest unit is called Poon. TON is the equivalent unit to BTC or ETH, and Poon is similar to satoshi or wei. TONs serve the following three core functions in Tokamak Network: i) to be used for deposit in order to ensure the security of a child chain, ii) to be used as transaction fees within the child chain, and iii) to be used to participate in PowerTON. Ton is used when deploying child chains and connecting them to Tokamak Network. Child chain operators must deposit more than a certain amount of TON to deploy and connect the child chain to the Tokamak Network. TON is also used to participate in the PowerTON game. PowerTon is a gamified method to distribute unissued commit reward from staking, which can only be played through TON. TON provides cryptoeconomic incentives for all child chains to operate securely. Operators participating in Tokamak Network must deposit a certain amount of TON to perform a particular action and may be challenged if they act against a predetermined rule.

  "TORN Token": "An ERC20-compatible token with a fixed supply that governs Tornado.Cash. TORN holders can make proposals and vote to change the protocol via governance. In order to participate in Tornado.Cash governance, users first need to lock tokens in the governance contract. If a user votes or creates a proposal, the tokens cannot be unlocked before the proposal execution period ends (8.25 days from proposal creation). The locked tokens can also be delegated to another address. To create a proposal, a user needs to have at least 1,000 TORN. All proposals must be smart contracts with verified code that are executed from the governance contract (using delegatecall). This way, it's easy to audit and test any governance changes. The voting period for a proposal is 3 days. A proposal will succeed if it receives a simple majority of votes and there are at least 25,000 TORN total votes (if turnout is too low, the proposal automatically fails). After a proposal succeeds, it is subject for a timelock of 2 days. After the timelock, any user is able to execute the proposal (which initiates the changes). If proposal is not executed for 3 days after that, it is considered expired and can no longer be executed.\n",

This environment, called an enclave, provides both integrity and confidentiality. Integrity means that it’s infeasible for an attacker to tamper with the code in an enclave. It ensures users that TC is acting as an honest oracle. Confidentiality means it’s also infeasible for an attacker to inspect the contents of an enclave. TC leverages TEE confidentiality to handle sensitive data safely---anything from passwords, to private keys controlling cryptocurrency, to personally identifying information. In short, you can think of an enclave as a black box, a hardened, opaque environment in which to run programs securely. You can think of TC as an oracle that runs in such a black box.\n",

Each portion or tranche of a securitized or structured product is one of several related securities offered at the same time, but with varying risks, rewards and maturities to appeal to a diverse range of investors.\n\nTranche is a French word meaning slice or portion. They are commonly found in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or asset-backed securities (ABS).\n\nSenior tranches typically contain assets with higher credit ratings than junior tranches. The senior tranches have first lien on the assets—they're in line to be repaid first, in case of default. Junior tranches have a second lien or no lien at all.\n",
  "Tranchess": "A tokenized asset management and derivatives trading protocol, which is inspired by tranche funds that cater to different class of investors with varying risk appetites.

It's EVM compatible and has a block time of around 3 seconds. They believe launching on BSC can decrease users' cost of gas fee and the waiting period between each transaction.\n",
  "Transaction": "The act of exchanging cryptocurrencies on a blockchain.\n",
  "Transaction Fee": "A cryptocurrency transaction fee that is charged to users when performing crypto transactions. The fee is collected in order to process the transaction on the network. Users need to pay the blockchain fee to ensure their cryptocurrency transfers arrive in a timely manner. The blockchain fee is one of the main tools used to speed up crypto transactions, which are often slow due to high congestion on the blockchain network. The lower the blockchain fee, the lower your transaction's priority in the blockchain network.\n",
  "Transaction ID": "A Transaction ID is basically an identification number for a transaction.\n",
  "Transaction Order Dependency": "In Ethereum, multiple transactions are included in a single block, which means that the state of a contract can be updated multiple times in the same block. If the order of two transactions calling the same smart contract changes the final outcome, an attacker could exploit this property. For example, given a contract which expects participant to submit the solution to a puzzle in exchange for a reward, a malicious contract owner could reduce the amount of the reward when the transaction is submitted.\n",
  "Transactions Per Second": "Transactions per second (TPS) is a computer software and hardware measurement that represents the number of transactions completed in one second by an information system.\n",
  "Transak": "A developer integration to onboard global users from fiat to crypto and back using local payment methods. Transak works with local payment methods in both eastern and western markets instead of just expensive card payments. By allowing deposits and withdrawals in fiat, decentralized applications can meet customers where they are and go mainstream. Apps can integrate our widget in a few lines of code or connect directly to our white-label API.\n",
  "Transmuter": "The primary pegging mechanism for the alchemical synthetic tokens. The Transmuter.sol contract powers the Transmuter. Harvested yield will flow directly to it as it comes in and ensures that participants will be guaranteed a 1:1 redemption of alUSD for DAI. \n\nUsers deposit alUSD into the Transmuter. As the yield comes in, it will credit users DAI proportional to the amount they have staked. When a user chooses to withdraw the converted DAI, an equal amount of alUSD will be burned.\n\nOne interesting side effect of this process is that a user's position can be over-filled. For example, a user deposits 1000 alUSD, and some time later, that staking position will have 1050 DAI filled. Once a user has gone past this limit, it is possible for other users to initialize a claim on their behalf. For any balance of DAI over their staked alUSD, the user who claimed on their behalf will have that surplus in amount immediately convert their staked alUSD. In the case of the example above, the user who claimed it will have 50 of their alUSD immediately converted into DAI. If the person who staked the alUSD claims their DAI with a surplus, the surplus will be cycled back into the Transmuter and be spread globally.\n\nThe Transmuter was upgraded and now deploys its capital into the yearn yvDAI vault. The yield it harvests is passed into the Alchemix Vault contract and boosts the yields of DAI depositors. This loop also effectively compounds yield in the system, thus helping to repay loans even faster. There is a 5 million DAI buffer that is not deployed to the yearn yvDAI vault in order to improve the UX of using the Transmuter by saving users gas for calling the transmute function.\n",
  "Trapdoor Function": "A function that is easy to compute in one direction, yet believed to be difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its inverse) without special information, called the \"trapdoor\". Trapdoor functions are widely used in cryptography.\n\nIn mathematical terms, if f is a trapdoor function there exists some secret information y, such that given f(x) and y it is easy to compute x. Consider a padlock and its key. It is trivial to change the padlock from open to closed without using the key, by pushing the shackle into the lock mechanism. Opening the padlock easily, however, requires the key to be used. Here the key is the trapdoor.\n\nTrapdoor functions came to prominence in cryptography in the mid-1970s with the publication of asymmetric (or public key) encryption techniques by Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle. Indeed, Diffie and Hellman first coined the term (Diffie and Hellman, 1976). Several function classes have been proposed, and it soon became obvious that trapdoor functions are harder to find than was initially thought. For example, an early suggestion was to use schemes based on the subset sum problem. This turned out -- rather quickly -- to be unsuitable.\n\nAs of 2004 , the best known trapdoor function (family) candidates are the RSA and Rabin families of functions. Both are written as exponentiation modulo a composite number, and both are related to the problem of prime factorization.\n\nFunctions related to the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem (either modulo a prime or in a group defined over an elliptic curve) are not known to be trapdoor functions, because there is no known \"trapdoor\" information about the group that enables the efficient computation of discrete logs. However, the discrete logarithm problem can be used as the basis for a trapdoor when the related problems called the computational Diffie–Hellman problem (CDH) and/or its decisional variant are used. The semantically secure version of the ElGamal Cryptosystem relies on the decision Diffie–Hellman problem (DDH). The Digital Signature Algorithm is based on CDH in a prime order subgroup.\n\nA trapdoor in cryptography has the very specific aforementioned meaning and is not to be confused with a backdoor (these are frequently used interchangeably and this is incorrect). A backdoor is a deliberate mechanism that is added to a cryptographic algorithm (e.g., a key pair generation algorithm, digital signing algorithm, etc.) or operating system, for example, that permits one or more unauthorized parties to bypass or subvert the security of the system in some fashion. \n",
  "Tratin": "An Ethereum ERC20 platform focusing on an open source peer-to-peer and business-to-customer cryptocurrency that offers secure, instant, decentralized and private transactions with unit value fungibility and Escrow function.

Every TRC-721 compliant contract must implement the TRC721 and TRC165 interfaces. Other extension interfaces can be implemented according to specific business requirements.\n",
  "Treasury Bill": "A short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less. Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $1,000. However, some can reach a maximum denomination of $5 million in non-competitive bids. These securities are widely regarded as low-risk and secure investments.\n\nThe Treasury Department sells T-Bills during auctions using a competitive and non-competitive bidding process. Noncompetitive bids—also known as non-competitive tenders—have a price based on the average of all the competitive bids received. T-Bills tend to have a high tangible net worth.\n\nThe U.S. government issues T-bills to fund various public projects, such as the construction of schools and highways. When an investor purchases a T-Bill, the U.S. government is effectively writing an IOU to the investor. T-bills are considered a safe and conservative investment since the U.S. government backs them.\n\nT-Bills are normally held until the maturity date. However, some holders may wish to cash out before maturity and realize the short-term interest gains by reselling the investment in the secondary market.\n\nT-bills can have maturities of just a few days or up to a maximum of 52 weeks, but common maturities are 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. The longer the maturity date, the higher the interest rate that the T-Bill will pay to the investor.\n\nT-bills are issued at a discount from the par value (also known as the face value) of the bill, meaning the purchase price is less than the face value of the bill. For example, a $1,000 bill might cost the investor $950 to buy the product.\n\nWhen the bill matures, the investor is paid the face value—par value—of the bill they bought. If the face value amount is greater than the purchase price, the difference is the interest earned for the investor. T-bills do not pay regular interest payments as with a coupon bond, but a T-Bill does include interest, reflected in the amount it pays when it matures.\n",
  "Treasury Bond": "Government debt securities issued by the U.S. Federal government that have maturities greater than 20 years. T-bonds earn periodic interest until maturity, at which point the owner is also paid a par amount equal to the principal.\n\nTreasury bonds are part of the larger category of U.S. sovereign debt known collectively as treasuries, which are typically regarded as virtually risk-free since they are backed by the U.S. government's ability to tax its citizens.\n\nTreasury bonds (T-bonds) are one of four types of debt issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to finance the U.S. government's spending activities. The four types of debt are Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). These securities vary by maturity and coupon payments.\n\nAll of them are considered benchmarks to their comparable fixed-income categories because they are virtually risk-free. T-bonds are backed by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government can raise taxes and increase revenue to ensure full payments. These investments are also considered benchmarks in their respective fixed-income categories because they offer a base risk-free rate of investment with the categories' lowest return. T-bonds have long durations, issued with maturities of between 20 and 30 years.\n\nAs is true for other government bonds, T-bonds make interest payments semiannually, and the income received is only taxed at the federal level. Treasury bonds are issued at monthly online auctions held directly by the U.S. Treasury. A bond's price and its yield are determined during the auction. After that, T-bonds are traded actively in the secondary market and can be purchased through a bank or broker.\n\nIndividual investors often use T-bonds to keep a portion of their retirement savings risk-free, to provide a steady income in retirement, or to set aside savings for a child's education or other major expenses. Investors must hold their T-bonds for a minimum of 45 days before they can be sold on the secondary market.\n",
  "Tree Finance": "The first project from WhalerDAO & intends to be a profitable engine for funding charitable ventures.\n",
  "Trend Analysis": "A technique used in technical analysis that attempts to predict future stock price movements based on recently observed trend data. Trend analysis tries to predict a trend, such as a bull market run, and ride that trend until data suggests a trend reversal, such as a bull-to-bear market. Trend analysis is helpful because moving with trends, and not against them, will lead to profit for an investor. It is based on the idea that what has happened in the past gives traders an idea of what will happen in the future. There are three main types of trends: short-, intermediate- and long-term.\n\nA trend is the general direction the market is taking during a specified period of time. Trends can be both upward and downward, relating to bullish and bearish markets, respectively. While there is no specified minimum amount of time required for a direction to be considered a trend, the longer the direction is maintained, the more notable the trend.\n\nTrend analysis is the process of looking at current trends in order to predict future ones and is considered a form of comparative analysis. This can include attempting to determine whether a current market trend, such as gains in a particular market sector, is likely to continue, as well as whether a trend in one market area could result in a trend in another. Though a trend analysis may involve a large amount of data, there is no guarantee that the results will be correct.\n",

  "Trickle": "An application that allows people to create hourly-rate-driven contracts between multiple parties in any ERC20-compatible tokens or stablecoins. It implements the most transparent monetary relationships between the customer and contractors (employer/employees, teams/players and so on). From the contractor's side, the agreement is 100% safe as tokens accrued to their balance are permanent. If the employer decides to cancel the agreement, the contractor just stops providing services, without losing a thing. From the employer's side, the employer doesn't lose too much when they get a bad contractor. It's the employer's responsibility to check how well the contractor is doing. And they can cancel the agreement at any time for a reason. Both the sender and the recipient have the ability to terminate the agreement. The key point is that in the case of agreement termination, the recipient receives tokens/stablecoins that have accrued on their balance up until the termination date, according to their fixed-hourly rate.\n",
  "Triffin's Dilemma": "\"Providing reserves and exchanges for the whole world is too much for one country and one currency to bear.\" — Henry H.

The protocol is a blockchain-based decentralized reservation marketplace facilitating direct transactions between Guests and Hosts through the use of Smart Contracts.\n",
  "TRIPS Token": "Native token in Trips Community. Used to create an internal economy and to keep track of the contribution of community members and train them up on the use of cryptocurrencies.\n",
  "TRND Token": "Native token of Trendering. To join the Trendering protocol, users need 130 TRND. It is their key. To operate within the Trendering protocol, they need xTRND. It is their fuel.\n",
  "Trojan Horse": "In computing, a Trojan horse (or simply trojan) is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.\n\nTrojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Trojans may allow an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity. It can also delete a user's files or infect other devices connected to the network.Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan.\n\nUnlike computer viruses, worms, and rogue security software, trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.\n",
  "TRON": "A decentralized blockchain platform for supporting smart contracts and high throughput. The team sees TRON as a future operating system which will allow developers to deploy their own decentralized applications. The team aims to build a TRON ecosystem that everyone can participate in and benefit from. Some of the features of TRON are： (1) Users are able to reduce costs, enjoy convenience, and build fortunes by using different DApp functions deployed in TRON; (2) Developers have a vast range of rights including deploying DApp in TRON net, expanding business and gaining traction as influencers and thought-leaders; and (3) Network witnesses demonstrate support for TRON and its abundant returns. Everyone will devote their energy to the construction of the TRON ecosystem, and will benefit from helping to build TRON regardless of their role as users, developers or TRON network witnesses. TRON uses a 3-layer architecture： Storage layer, Core layer and Application layer.\n",
  "TRON Virtual Machine": "A lightweight, Turing complete virtual machine developed for the TRON's ecosystem. Its goal is to provide millions of global developers with a custom-built blockchain system that is efficient, convenient, stable, secure and scalable.\n\nTRON Virtual Machine (TVM) connects seamlessly with the existing development ecosystem and supports DPOS. TVM is initially compatible with the EVM environment so that instead of learning a new programming language, developers can develop, debug, and compile smart contracts in a Remix environment using Solidity and other languages. Once users have built and uploaded their smart contract to TRON’s mainnet, it will be executed on the TVM of the SR node to be isolated from external connections.\n\nFurthermore, TVM employs the concept of Bandwidth. Different from the gas mechanism on Ethereum’s EVM, transaction operations or smart contracts on TVM are free, consuming no tokens. Technically, the total token holding does not restrict executable computation capacity on TVM. \n",
  "Tronix Token": "The Mainnet token based on the TRON Protocol issued by TRON Foundation. It is also known as TRX. TRX is the basic unit of accounts on the TRON blockchain. The value of all other tokens derives from that of TRON. TRX is also a natural medium currency for all TRC-based tokens. TRX connects the entire TRON ecosystem, with abundant application scenarios that power transactions and applications on the chain. TRX can be used for credit card payment, withdrawals through ATM machines, purchase of TRON merchandise, participating in token issuance on TRON, obtaining energy and bandwidth, obtaining voting rights, receiving BTT airdrops, participating in the Tronics Support Plan, pay for porn on Pornhub, and to buy virtual gifts.\n",

TronZ is the name of shielded trc10 token.\n\nIn shielded transaction of transfering TronZ, the sender and the receiver's address and transfer amount can both be completely confidential.\n\nIn shielded transaction of transfering TronZ, there are two types of address:\n\n \"t-addr\" (Transparent Address)\n \"z-addr\" (Shielded Address)\n\n\"t-addr\" address uses TRON account model. \"z-addr\" address uses Anonymous account model.\n",
  "Tronz World": "An international crowdfunding platform on the Tron Blockchain. It uses a software algorithm that distributes affiliate commissions between community members after the observation of certain conditions. The code is in public domain.\n",
  "Trove": "Product of Liquity Protocol. A Trove is where users take out and maintain their loan. Each Trove is linked to an Ethereum address and each address can have just one Trove. If users are familiar with Vaults or CDPs from other platforms, Troves are similar in concept.\n\nTroves maintain two balances: one is an asset (ETH) acting as collateral and the other is a debt denominated in LUSD. Users can change the amount of each by adding collateral or repaying debt. As they make these balance changes, their Trove’s collateral ratio changes accordingly.\n\nUsers can close their Trove at any time by fully paying off their debt.\n",
  "Troy Ounce": "A unit of measure used for weighing precious metals that dates back to the Middle Ages. Originally used in Troyes, France, one troy ounce is equal to 31.1034768 grams, according to the U.K. Royal Mint. One standard ounce, used to weigh other items such as sugar and grain, is slightly less at 28.35 grams. The troy ounce is retained even today as the standard unit of measurement in the precious metals market to ensure purity standards and other common measures remain consistent over time. The troy ounce is often abbreviated to read \"t oz\" or \"oz t.\"\n\nSome historians believe the troy ounce had its origins in Roman times. Romans standardized their monetary system using bronze bars that could be broken down into 12 pieces called \"uncia\" or ounce, with each piece weighing around 31.1 grams. As Europe's economic importance grew from the 10th century onward, merchants came from all over the world to buy and sell goods there. It was, therefore, necessary to develop a new standardized monetary weight system to make doing business much easier. Some believe the merchants of Troyes modeled this new monetary system using the same weights as their Roman ancestors.\n\nThe troy ounce is the only measure of the troy weighting system that is still used in modern times. It is used in the pricing of metals, such as gold, platinum, and silver.\n",
  "TRU Token": "Native token of TrueFi. On TrueFi, lending is uncollateralized. To allow vetted borrowers to request for loans on the protocol, users stake TRU to assess the creditworthiness of the loans with either a YES or a NO. If YES, borrowers are allowed to borrow.\n",
  "Truebit": "A blockchain enhancement which enables smart contracts to securely perform complex computations in standard programming languages at reduced gas costs. While smart contracts can perform small computations correctly, large computation tasks pose security risks for blockchains. Truebit counteracts this shortcoming via a trustless, retrofitting oracle which correctly performs computational tasks. Any smart contract can issue a computation task to this oracle in the form of WebAssembly bytecode, while anonymous \"miners\" receive rewards for correctly solving the task. The oracle's protocol guarantees correctness in two layers: a unanimous consensus layer where anyone can object to faulty solutions, and an on-chain mechanism which incentivizes participation and ensures fair remuneration. These components formally manifest themselves through a combination of novel, off-chain architecture and on-chain smart contracts. Rather than relying on external, cryptographic proofs of correctness, Truebit leverages game theoretic principles to effectively increase the on-chain computation power of existing networks.\n",
  "TrueFi": "An uncollateralized lending DeFi protocol, powered by TRU. It allows lenders to earn high, stable returns on loaned cryptocurrencies (starting with TUSD) while having full transparency on how the loaned capital is allocated. Vetted borrowers, meanwhile, can use TrueFi for rapid access to fixed-term, fixed-rate cryptocurrency loans. TRU holders collectively assess the creditworthiness of the borrower and individual loan applications by staking TRU. Though TrueFi was initially built by the TrustToken team, who previously developed five top fiat-backed stablecoins, TrueFi is following a path towards progressive decentralization and will ultimately put the protocol in the hands of the community. TrueFi enables uncollateralized lending through the interaction of three stakeholders: (1) Lenders earn attractive APY on their cryptocurrency by lending TUSD to TrueFi lending pools, while enjoying full transparency of how their funds are allocated. Lenders may also farm TRU alongside their yields. TrueFi lending pools will initially be controlled by TrustToken, Inc; (2) TRU Stakers assess the creditworthiness of each incoming loan request on the credit prediction market by staking YES or NO; and (3) Vetted Borrowers to request loans denominated in TUSD using loan tokens.\n",
  "TrueUSD": "TrueUSD is a regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.\n",
  "Truffle": "Truffle is a development environment, testing framework and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).\n",

Trust Browser is a full-fledged Web3 browser that allows you to interact with decentralized applications (DApp) directly from the crypto wallet app. Trust Wallet also offers users an easy way to keep all your unique ERC721 and ERC1155 crypto collectibles and game assets in one place.\n",
  "Trusted Execution Environment": "An environment for executing code, in which those executing the code can have high levels of trust in that surrounding environment, because it can ignore threats from the rest of the device.\n\nThere are many interpretations of what is meant by Trust. In the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), it is used to imply that users may have a higher level of trust in validity, isolation and access control in items (assets) stored in this space, when compared to more general purpose software environments. This then ripples down to an assertion that the Trusted OS and Trusted Applications executing inside that space are more trustworthy.\n\nIn the TEE, that Trust requires that all TEE related assets, code, the underlying Trusted OS and its support code, have been installed and started through a methodology that requires its initial state to be as expected by the designers (i.e. EVERYTHING is signature checked, immutable, or held in isolation).\n\nTEEs only accept code for execution that has been:\n\n Appropriately authorized\n And where that authorization has been checked by other authorized code\n And that includes everything from after ROM boot\n (users can consider the ROM code authorized by its presence).\n",
  "Trustless": "A trustless system means that the participants involved do not need to know or trust each other or a third party for the system to function. In a trustless environment, there is no single entity that has authority over the system, and consensus is achieved without participants having to know or trust anything but the system itself.\n",
  "Trustless Bitcoin": "A fully Bitcoin-backed ERC-20 token pegged to the price of Bitcoin. It facilitates Bitcoin holders to act on the Ethereum blockchain and access the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. tBTC is an open-source project supported by groups including Keep, Summa and the Cross-Chain Group. tBTC does not attempt to maintain the peg. It's a supply peg not a price peg, so there is no algorithmic mechanism needed to function as a decentralized peg. That means BTC/tBTC might not be exactly the same. tBTC might trade at a slight premium or a discount.\n",
  "Trustless Economic Bandwidth": "The ability to transfer value simultaneously without using a trusted intermediary.\n",
  "Trustless Fund Protocol": "An advanced timelock for ETH and ERC-20 assets. Using Trustless Fund, you can lock in the time value of your money. Features include 0% fees, non-custodial ownership of funds, unlimited funds, lock period increases, and beneficiary management. The use case of the protocol includes gifts (e.g. locking up tokens as a birthday gift so they can get a nice surprise for the next birthday), savings, speculation (e.g. think your portfolio will rise astronomically in the next 10 years, lock up your tokens to prevent your weak hands from getting the best of you), earning, and vesting.\n",
  "Trustless Issuance ": "The creation policy of an asset isn’t dependent on and can’t be manipulated by a self-interested third-party.\n",

  "Trustlines Network": "A decentralized, permissionless and open platform to host currency networks. The value in these currency networks is represented in IOUs (abbreviation for 'I owe you') issued by its participants. The design extends on the original Ripple idea with a strong focus on ease of adoption. The platform is designed in a way that there is no need to interact with any centralized services such as banks or exchanges. Besides, it comes complemented with a reference implementation of a mobile application.\n",
  "Trustlines Network Coin": "One of two tokens on the Trustlines Network. The Trustlines Network Coin (TLC) is the native token of the Trustlines Blockchain, which means it is useful for people who are using the Trustlines Protocol in their everyday lives. Any user wanting to pay their own transaction fees must obtain TLC. TLC can be purchased directly, or instead users can buy TLN and convert it to TLC. Typically, it is the relay server operators that enable delegate services who use the most TLC.\n",
  "Trustlines Network Token": "One of two tokens on the Trustlines Network. The Trustlines Network Token (TLN) is an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum mainchain. Since this is a popular token standard, TLN is highly versatile, easily transferable, and generally very accessible for the Ethereum community. TLN is currently required for staking in the validator auctions for the Trustlines Blockchain. Trustlines Network Tokens (TLN) are distributed via a Merkle drop to a wide range of recipients. TLN can be converted into Trustlines Network Coin (TLC) via a bridge. No bridge exists for TLC to TLN conversion.\n",
  "TULIP Token": "Native token of SolFarm. The TULIP token is designed to shift towards governance. Currently, on-chain governance is not available but is being developed by the Solana Foundation. Once this is ready, the protocol will shift governance to token holders.

  "Turbo-Geth": "Alternative implementation of [Ethereum](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recHnQzGJpRxx1FFd) (Eth 1.x), derived from go-ethereum. The main difference between turbo-geth and go-ethereum is in the way the database is used to store and access the Ethereum state and its history. This change has a profound effect on many parts of the code. Currently, turbo-geth only supports full sync from genesis block, but it will support snapshot sync which is more efficient than fast sync and more secure than warp sync. Turbo-geth is also used as a platform for the research into Stateless Ethereum.\n",
  "Turing Complete": "A term that refers to a machine that, given enough time and memory along with the necessary instructions, can solve any computational problem, no matter how complex.\n",
  "Two Factor Authentication": "An authentication method in which a computer user is granted access only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence (or factors) to an authentication mechanism: knowledge (something the user and only the user knows), possession (something the user and only the user has), and inherence (something the user and only the user is).\n",
  "Typhoon Cash": "A yield-capable private transactions protocol based on Tornado Cash. The developers identified areas of improvement to the Tornado Cash model in both tokenomics and design, so they forked Tornado Cash and implemented these improvements. Tokenomic of Typhoon cash includes a very simple 0.5% fee per transaction that is automatically sent to the reserve contract that will automate buy and burn of the PHOON token. This makes PHOON tokens more scarce after each transaction. Scarcity increases faster along with usage. The team believes that providing a larger set of notes in the system can greatly improve usability of a private transaction protocol. The tradeoff here is to remove the relayer system from Tornado Cash. By removing relayers, value can be attributed to the protocol instead of leaving the system. The team plans to soon enable relayers via Keep3r Network.\n",
  "Typographical Error": "A typographical error can occur for example when the intent of a defined operation is to sum a number to a variable (+=) but it has accidentally been defined in a wrong way (=+), introducing a typo which happens to be a valid operator. Instead of calculating the sum it initializes the variable again. The unary + operator is deprecated in new solidity compiler versions. The weakness can be avoided by performing pre-condition checks on any math operation or using a vetted library for arithmetic calculations such as SafeMath developed by OpenZeppelin.\n",
  "Ubex": "Platform where users can launch advertising campaigns in 5 minutes in a user-friendly interface, and smart Ubex algorithms will help you achieve maximum efficiency. The platform's goal is to give all over the world users an opportunity to launch effective advertising campaigns at the lowest costs with a convenient interface, full control, target audience only, and with consolidated reports and accounting.

Monthly subscriptions come in different tiers from free to enterprise.\n",
  "UBI Token": "The first application to be built on top of the Proof of Humanity registry, an anti-Sybil attack tool designed by Kleros. The UBI token will be streamed directly to an Ethereum address as long as it gets verified as a human in the Proof of Humanity registry and starts the accrual process, establishing a fair and ongoing distribution model. It will provide universal access to liquidity that serves to inhibit financial coercion of public decisions and will be tradeable in all open markets. The ability to develop a reliable self-sovereign identity validation process brought on by Proof of Humanity has established the bedrock for the infrastructure required to make a Universal Basic Income (UBI) mechanism that can reach everyone on Earth. Therefore, in order to consolidate the governance and financial logic able to establish borderless democratic autonomous organizations, Kleros and Democracy Earth have designed the UBI token distribution mechanism to be based on time and humanity.\n",
  "Ubiq": "Blockchain that is built upon an improved version of the Ethereum Codebase, putting stability at its core. Ubiq offers an enterprise-stable platform by implementing well established and thoroughly tested EVM code. This code, coupled with a conservative upgrade schedule, reduces the risk of network instability and unintended hard-forks. Just as Ubiq is permissionless open-source software, Ubiq's governance system 'Escher' democratizes the direction of the platform's development by providing our users an on-chain vote. Important proposal decisions are entrusted to the community at-large through transparent, verifiable, immutable public voting. In an independent benchmark, it was found that given the same hashrate, Ubiq has 90% fewer uncles than Ethereum, leading to greater chain security, improving the reliability of the network. It was also found that Ubiq's transactional throughput per second is 2x that of Ethereum's at a 40 million block gas limit.\n",
  "UBXT Token": "The UpBots platform utility token. UBXT plays a central role in the operation of the UpBots platform and in creating a win-win ecosystem that rewards all participants for helping each other. UBXT will primarily be used for subscription payments and performance fees between community members for the services they provide to each other such as training courses, Algo bot rental, copy trading and signal providing as well as other services available in the UpBots market place. Furthermore, UBXT is used to pay for performance fees, allows community members to rent their services and earn a percent of the profits when their clients win a trade. UBXT also serves as a means of providing even more value to the community through holding a staking program. This is achieved by creating staking pools and allocating a percentage of platform and performance fee profits to the pools. Over time this will develop into a more comprehensive hold program where UBXT holders can earn a host of additional benefits.\n",
  "UMA Protocol": "An open-source infrastructure for deploying and enforcing synthetic assets on Ethereum. UMA enables developers to quickly and easily build synthetic tokens that track the price of anything. UMA stands for Universal Market Access. UMA is driven by a shared belief that financial markets should be free, open, and fair.

  "Uncle Bandit Attack": "Bundles are groups of transactions Flashbots users submit. Those transactions must be included in the order submitted, and either the whole bundle is included, or nothing is. A bundle should never be split up.\n\nRobert Miller found that for a specific bundle, only the \"Buy\" part of a sandwich bundle submitted had landed on-chain, and right after that Buy someone else had inserted a 7 gas transaction that arbitraged it.\n\nHow?\n\nIn Ethereum occasionally two blocks are mined at roughly the same time, and only one block can be added to the chain. The other gets \"uncled\" or orphaned. Anyone can access transactions in an uncled block and some of the transactions may not have ended up in the non-uncled block. In a way some transactions end up in a sort of mempool like state: they are now public as a part of the uncled block and perhaps still valid too.\n\nA Sandwicher's bundle was included in an uncled block. An attacker saw this, grabbed only the Buy part of the Sandwich, threw away the rest, and added an arbitrage after. The attacker then submitted that as a bundle, which was then mined.\n\nInstead of seeing something late in time and rewinding it (time-bandit attack), the uncle bandit attack is when an attacker sees something in an uncle and brings it forward. This also shows that attacks extend beyond the mempool and into uncled blocks as well.\n",
  "Uncle Block": "Uncle blocks are created in [Ethereum](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recHnQzGJpRxx1FFd) blockchains when two blocks are mined and submitted to the ledger at roughly the same time. Only one can enter the ledger as a block, and the other does not. The one that is not validated is an uncle block.\n",
  "Unconfirmed": "A state in which a transaction has not been appended to the blockchain.\n",
  "Underwriters": "Compound, MakerDAO, and other DeFi protocols require user positions to be liquidated if their underlying collateral becomes worth too little. In KeeperDAO, under-writers are special contracts that \"wrap\" user positions using the KeeperDAO protocol. This allows keepers to safely close user positions without liquidating them, minimising user losses, especially in volatile markets. In return, the under-writers charge a small fee. This fee is less than the user would have lost if they had not used the under-writer, but, because under-writers competely remove the need for priority gas auctions (PGAs), the fee can still be more than the keeper would have made through an \"unwrapped\" liquidation on the underlying protocol. This gives the best to both worlds: users minimise losses, and keepers maximise profits.\n",
  "Unhandled Exceptions": "Some low-level operations in Solidity such as send, which is used to send Ether, do not throw an exception on failure, but rather report the status by returning a boolean. If this return value is unchecked, the caller continues its execution even if the payment failed, which can easily lead to inconsistencies.\n",
  "UNIC Token": "Governance token of Unicly. UNIC will be capped at 1M total supply, and the inflation rate will decrease approximately once a month.\n\nThere will be a voting portal on the platform where UNIC token holders will be able to vote for proposals. The protocol will mainly need the UNIC community to vote for new uToken pairs to whitelist. 2% of the total supply of UNIC will be needed to create a new proposal. 6.25% of the total supply of UNIC will be needed for a proposal to reach quorum. Of the 6.25%, the majority must be in favor of the proposal for it to pass. All governance will occur transparently and fully onchain. Unicly’s smart contracts will be made permissionless and community-owned (through TimeLock and GovernorAlpha contracts) following initial deployments and launch.\n",
  "Unicly": "A permissionless, community-governed protocol to combine, fractionalize, and trade NFTs. Built by NFT collectors and DeFi enthusiasts, the protocol incentivizes NFT liquidity and provides a seamless trading experience for NFT assets by bringing Automated Market Makers (AMMs) and yield farming into the world of NFTs.\n\nBuying NFTs is quite a laborious process. Fungible tokens may have thousands of buyers and sellers, but every NFT transaction depends on matching a single buyer and a single seller, which leads to low liquidity. In addition, many users are being priced out of some of the most desirable items, leading to more concentrated ownership and pent-up demand. Furthermore, it is difficult for an average investor to build a large, diverse portfolio of NFTs, which makes investing in them inherently riskier. As a result, the NFT space is experiencing accessibility issues.\n\nFractionalization allows more people to trade NFTs at lower price points, enabling more individuals to have ownership of even the most coveted NFTs. It even allows casual investors to buy small amounts in NFT projects that they like as if they were liquid tokens.\n\nUnicly will attract and incentivize all stakeholders in the wider blockchain ecosystem to participate in the NFT ecosystem. Just like how projects launch tokens on Uniswap, collectors and/or creators will be able to launch exciting NFT collections through Unicly, and benefit from better price discovery and more accessibility. Traders and casual investors will experience higher liquidity on a familiar AMM model. Meanwhile, yield farmers will be incentivized to earn rewards by providing liquidity.\n",

  "UniLend": "A permissionless decentralized DeFi protocol that combines spot trading services and money markets with lending and borrowing services through smart contracts. In the money markets, the interest rates and collateralization ratio are based on supply, demand, and other market forces and borrowing limits are decided by liquidity in the trading pairs. The integrated smart contract for both features of the protocol allows both trading & DeFi capabilities to co-exist within the same protocol. This solves the liquidity and liquidation issue which has been limiting the growth of DeFi adoption to a broader market.\n",

  "Uniswap": "An on-chain system of smart contracts on the [Ethereum](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recHnQzGJpRxx1FFd) blockchain, implementing an automated liquidity protocol based on a “constant product formula.” In V1 of the protocol, each pair on the protocol stores pooled reserves of two assets, and provides liquidity for those two assets, maintaining the invariant that the product of the reserves cannot decrease. Traders pay a 30-basis-point fee on trades, which goes to liquidity providers. V2 is a new implementation based on the same formula, with several new highly desirable features. Most significantly, it enables the creation of arbitrary ERC20/ERC20 pairs, rather than supporting only pairs between ERC20 and ETH. It also provides a hardened price oracle that accumulates the relative price of the two assets at the beginning of each block. This allows other contracts on Ethereum to estimate the time-weighted average price for the two assets over arbitrary intervals. Finally, it enables “flash swaps” where users can receive assets freely and use them elsewhere on the chain, only paying for (or returning) those assets at the end of the transaction.\n",
  "Uniswap Protocol Token": "Native governance token of Uniswap Protocol.

By looking at the delta between the price when a UTXO was created vs. the current price of an asset, it can determined whether the specific coins in that UTXO are in a state of unrealized profit (price has increased) or loss (price has decreased), and to what extent. Unrealized Profit is defined as the total profit (in USD) of all coins in existence whose price at realization time was lower than the current price, normalized by the market cap.\n",
  "Unrestricted Action": "Contracts often perform authorization, by checking the sender of the message, to restrict the type of action that a user can take. Typically, only the owner of a contract should be allowed to destroy the contract or set a new owner.

  "Unspent Transaction Output Chains": "A blockchain that uses the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) accounting method (such as the Bitcoin and Litecoin blockchains), as opposed to an account-based accounting method. On the protocol layer of UTXO chains, there are no accounts or wallets. Instead, coins are stored as a list of UTXOs. The term \"unspent transaction output\" is a reference to the fact that a UTXO represents the output of a transaction received by a user, which that user can spend in the future (as it is still \"unspent\"). It is another way of referring to a balance of coins (e.g. BTC) controlled by a specific address. Under this model, transactions are created by consuming existing UTXOs and producing new ones in their place. UTXOs can be divided or combined to reach the denomination required in a given transaction. This concept can be illustrated with an analogy to cash.\n",

It's registered on a blockchain, you own it with a key and no one can take it away from you. Urbit IDs are cryptographic property. Urbit IDs aren't money, but they are scarce, so each one costs something. This means that when you meet a stranger on the Urbit network, they have some skin in the game and are less likely to be a bot or a spammer.

Most decentralized blockchain networks rely on some form of validator node to process on-chain transactions in a permissionless and distributed manner.\n",
  "Validity Proofs": "Validity Proofs present evidence that a state transition is correct. They reflect a more pessimistic view of the world. Blocks include values representing L2 state if, and only if, that state is correct.\n\nA representation of some off-chain computation is sent to a smart contract. The smart contract updates the blockchain with this new value only after it is verified as correct. The main advantages of Validity Proofs are that the blockchain will always reflect a correct L2 state, and that a new state can be immediately relied upon and used. The main disadvantage is that proofs are needed for each and every state transition, and not merely when such a transition is contested, and this impacts scalability.\n",
  "Validium": "Layer 2 solution that uses validity proofs like ZK-rollups but data is not stored on the main layer 1 Ethereum chain. This can lead to 10k transactions per second per validium chain and multiple chains can be run in parallel.\n\nPros include: (1) No withdrawal delay (no latency to on-chain/cross-chain tx); consequent greater capital efficiency; and (2) Not vulnerable to certain economic attacks faced by fraud-proof based systems in high-value applications.\n\nCons include: (1) Limited support for general computation/smart contracts; specialized languages required; (2) High computational power required to generate ZK proofs; not cost effective for low throughput applications; and (3) Slower subjective finality time (10-30 min to generate a ZK proof) (but faster to full finality because there is no dispute time delay).\n",

  "VectorDAO": "A collective of designers in crypto on a mission to accelerate the mainstream adoption of crypto protocols through design and investment.\n",
  "Vega": "Vega measures how much the value of an option changes when the implied volatility (IV) of that option changes. Buyer’s side calls and puts both have positive vega and, all things being equal, make money when implied volatility rises. Writer’s side calls and puts both have negative vega and, all things being equal, make money when implied volatility falls.\n\nLike gamma and theta, vega is highest for the ATM options, and drops for the OTM and ITM options. So, ATM options with lots of time to expiration are the most sensitive to changes in implied volatility. The more time there is until expiration, the higher the vega is for an option. Vega also depends on where the price of the underlying asset is relative to the strike price of the option.\n",

  "Ventup": "An IDO Launchpad for high-growth potential projects powered by Cardano. Ventup.io will launch on Ethereum by Q2 2021. They are working very hard and their team is looking forward to migrate to the Cardano blockchain by Q3 2021. Ventup.io is being developed on the Cardano blockchain for the following reasons:\n\n Fast Transactions\n Scalable and sustainable\n Security built-in\n Interoperability\n Engaged Community\n Most Decentralised Blockchain\n",
  "Venture Capitalist": "A private equity investor that provides capital to companies exhibiting high growth potential in exchange for an equity stake. This could be funding startup ventures or supporting small companies that wish to expand but do not have access to equities markets. VCs experience high rates of failure due to the uncertainty that is involved with new and unproven companies.\n\nVenture capitalists are usually formed as limited partnerships (LP) where the partners invest in the VC fund. The fund normally has a committee that is tasked with making investment decisions. Once promising emerging growth companies have been identified, the pooled investor capital is deployed to fund these firms in exchange for a sizable stake of equity.\n\nContrary to public opinion. VCs do not normally fund startups from the onset. Rather, they seek to target firms that are at the stage where they are looking to commercialize their idea. The VC fund will buy a stake in these firms, nurture their growth and look to cash out with a substantial return on investment (ROI).\n\nVenture capitalists look for a strong management team, a large potential market and a unique product or service with a strong competitive advantage. They also look for opportunities in industries that they are familiar with, and the chance to own a large percentage of the company so that they can influence its direction.\n\nVCs are willing to risk investing in such companies because they can earn a massive return on their investments if these companies are a success. However, VCs experience high rates of failure due to the uncertainty that is involved with new and unproven companies.\n\nWealthy individuals, insurance companies, pension funds, foundations, and corporate pension funds may pool money together into a fund to be controlled by a VC firm. All partners have part ownership over the fund, but it is the VC firm that controls where the fund is invested, usually into businesses or ventures that most banks or capital markets would consider too risky for investment. The venture capital firm is the general partner, while the pension funds, insurance companies, etc. are limited partners.\n\nPayment is made to the venture capital fund managers in the form of management fees and carried interest. Depending on the firm, roughly 20% of the profits are paid to the company managing the private equity fund, while the rest goes to the limited partners who invested in the fund. General partners are usually also due to an additional 2% fee.\n",
  "Venus Protocol": "A Decentralized Marketplace for Lenders and Borrowers with Borderless Stablecoins. Venus enables the world's first decentralized stablecoin, VAI, built on Binance Smart Chain that is backed by a basket of stablecoins and crypto assets without centralized control. Funds held within the protocol can earn APY's based on the market demand for that asset. Interest is earned by the block and can be used as collateral to borrow assets or to mint stablecoins. Users can now tokenize their assets utilizing the Binance Smart Chain and receive portable vTokens that they can freely move around to cold storage, transfer to other users, and more. They can use their vToken collateral to borrow from the Venus Protocol instantly with no trading fees, no slippage and directly on-chain. With Venus, users have on-demand liquidity available globally.\n",
  "Venus Reward Token": "Venus Reward Token (VRT) is a mechanism created to become an additional mining distribution to suppliers and borrowers of Venus Protocol. The goal is to gradually lower XVS inflation rate and also include burning XVS throughout this process. Since XVS is the Governance token that controls the entire protocol, the team's goal is to make the total supply lower over time to make Governance more secure. In substitution to this, they realize that a lucrative APY yield created by the protocol is important. VRT will have a total supply of 30 billion and be distributed to users over the course of 4 years while they plan to have the XVS distribution double to around 8 years to complement the reductions. All of this is subject to Governance changes and on-chain proposals.\n\nVRT core value is that is the reward point for using the protocol. There will be a vVRT market on Venus so users can re-compound their VRT and earn/borrow against it. VRT distribution rates will be controlled by the Venus Governance modules.\n",
  "Venus Token": "The Venus Protocol is governed by the Venus Token (XVS), which is designed to be a \"fair launch\" cryptocurrency. There are no founder, team, or developer allocations, and XVS can only be earned through the Binance LaunchPool project or through providing liquidity to the protocol. There will be an initial 20% of the total supply of 30,000,000 (6,000,000 XVS) allocated to the Binance LaunchPool project where users can mine (farm) these tokens alongside 1% of the total supply (300,000 XVS) placed aside for the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem grants. Mard is king. The remainder of the supply will be exclusively available for the protocol, which will result in 23,700,000 XVS mined over a period of approximately four years, which begins after the Binance LaunchPool event at a rate 0.64 XVS per block (18,493 per day). The distribution of XVS is based on liquidity mining, where 35% of the daily rewards get distributed to borrowers, 35% to suppliers, and 30% for stablecoin minters.\n",

  "Virtual Machine": "In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.\n",
  "Virtual Private Network": "A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network. Encryption is a common, although not an inherent, part of a VPN connection. VPN technology was developed to provide access to corporate applications and resources to remote or mobile users, and to branch offices. For security, the private network connection may be established using an encrypted layered tunneling protocol, and users may be required to pass various authentication methods to gain access to the VPN. In other applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to circumvent geo-blocking and censorship or to connect to proxy servers to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on the Internet. Some websites, however, block access to known VPN technology to prevent the circumvention of their geo-restrictions, and many VPN providers have been developing strategies to get around these blockades.\n",
  "Virtual Reality": "A simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality include entertainment (e.g. video games), education (e.g. medical or military training) and business (e.g. virtual meetings). Other distinct types of VR-style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality, sometimes referred to as extended reality or XR.\n\nOne may distinguish between two types of VR; immersive VR and text-based networked VR (also known as \"Cyberspace\"). The immersive VR changes your view, when you move your head. While both VRs are appropriate for training, Cyberspace is preferred for distance learning. In some cases these two types are even complementary to each other.\n\nCurrently, standard virtual reality systems use either virtual reality headsets or multi-projected environments to generate realistic images, sounds and other sensations that simulate a user's physical presence in a virtual environment. A person using virtual reality equipment is able to look around the artificial world, move around in it, and interact with virtual features or items. The effect is commonly created by VR headsets consisting of a head-mounted display with a small screen in front of the eyes, but can also be created through specially designed rooms with multiple large screens. Virtual reality typically incorporates auditory and video feedback, but may also allow other types of sensory and force feedback through haptic technology.\n",
  "Virus": "A harmful piece of software that can copy itself and spread from one computer to another. Viruses are designed to attach to legitimate software programs, files, and documents and will be hidden and inactive until the circumstances match those required by the creator. The primary circumstance is that you must open or run the legitimate software. Once activated, it can do many things including: (1) Destroy your data; (2) Spam your contacts; (3) Record and share your personal, private information; and (4) even take over your whole computer. Viruses can be spread through any device with a computer including phones. Increased awareness, having certainty in people who send you software and having premium antivirus software can keep you safe.\n",
  "Vishing": "A combination of \"voice\" and \"phishing.\" It is a phone scam designed to get users to share personal information. During a vishing phone call, a scammer uses social engineering to get you to share personal information and financial details, such as account numbers and passwords. The scammer might say your account has been compromised, claim to represent your bank or law enforcement, or offer to help you install software.\n\nVishing is just one form of phishing, which is any type of message — such as an email, text, phone call or direct-chat message — that appears to be from a trusted source, but isn't. The goal is to steal someone's identity or money.\n\nIt's getting easier to contact more people, too.

VITA tokens grant the rights to participate in a) which IP is funded; b) how it is funded; c) how it is governed; d) how the VitaDAO treasury is governed. As such, VITA grants no ownership of the IP or expectations of profits surrounding it. VITA holders have no rights to any of the IP held by VitaDAO, but decide how it is commercialised and brought to patients. VITA is designed following a sustainability loop principle. As R&D projects are funded and begin producing data, their respective value grows, increasing the overall value of VitaDAO. As the VITA ecosystem grows, more funds become available, attracting higher quality IP and enabling the funding of further projects and growing the VitaDAO ecosystem.\n\nVitaDAO is governed by 3 core stakeholder groups:\n\n1. VitaDAO Members that hold VITA and participate in governance.\n2. Working groups consisting of select individuals that steward the organization.\n3. Service providers consisting of organizations that provide core infrastructure or services.\n",

  "Voice": "An NFT platform for emerging creators. It is a social platform where users can create digital arts across all formats – visual, written, audio and video – enabling them to be easily bought and sold as unique digital artifacts (NFTs). At the heart of this move is their core strength: tokenization. Instead of putting tokens next to creative content, the content itself will be the token. They are working hard to enable everyone who engages (likes, comments, etc.) to receive a royalty from its sale, as well. This is social as it should be, where the value of creative content is shared with those who support it.\n",
  "Volatility": "A statistical measure of the dispersion of returns for a given security or market index. In most cases, the higher the volatility, the riskier the security. Volatility is often measured as either the standard deviation or variance between returns from that same security or market index. In the securities markets, volatility is often associated with big swings in either direction. For example, when the stock market rises and falls more than one percent over a sustained period of time, it is called a \"volatile\" market. An asset's volatility is a key factor when pricing options contracts.\n",
  "Volume": "The amount of an asset or security that changes hands over some period of time, often over the course of a day. For instance, stock trading volume would refer to the number of shares of a security traded between its daily open and close. Trading volume, and changes to volume over the course of time, are important inputs for technical traders.\n",
  "Volume Weighted Average Price": "A trading benchmark used by traders that gives the average price a security has traded at throughout the day, based on both volume and price. It is important because it provides traders with insight into both the trend and value of a security. Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is calculated by adding up the dollars traded for every transaction (price multiplied by the number of shares traded) and then dividing by the total shares traded. The VWAP appears as a single line on intraday charts (1 minute, 15 minute, and so on), similar to how a moving average looks.\n\nLarge institutional buyers and mutual funds use the VWAP ratio to help move into or out of stocks with as small of a market impact as possible. Therefore, when possible, institutions will try to buy below the VWAP, or sell above it. This way their actions push the price back toward the average, instead of away from it.\n\nTraders may use VWAP as a trend confirmation tool, and build trading rules around it. For example, when the price is above VWAP they may prefer to initiate long positions. When the price is below VWAP they may prefer to initiate short positions.\n",
  "Volume-to-Market Cap Ratio": "A financial metric measuring how efficient is the price discovery for a project's native token. Calculated as the daily trading volume for the project's native token divided by its market cap.\n",

On the other side, there are people who borrow from this pool generating interest to all the suppliers. The firm is preparing to issue debit card for daily activities, while funds in user’s account are earning interest 24/7.\n",
  "Voxel": "In 3D computer graphics, a voxel represents a value on a regular grid in three-dimensional space. As with pixels in a 2D bitmap, voxels themselves do not typically have their position (i.e. coordinates) explicitly encoded with their values.

Crypto wallets can also be used to generate new blockchain addresses.\n\nUnlike the traditional wallets we use in our everyday life, cryptocurrency wallets don't really store your funds. In fact, your coins (or tokens) are simply part of a blockchain system as pieces of data, and the wallets serve as a means to access them.\n\nThere are three major groups of cryptocurrency wallets: software, hardware, and paper wallets. But, they may also be defined as hot wallets or cold wallets according to the way they function. Hot wallets are the ones that are somehow connected to the Internet and, thus, are more susceptible to hacking attacks. Cold wallets are the ones that generate keys without any Internet connection, which make them highly resistant to cyber attacks.\n",

The connection is initiated by one peer displaying a QR Code or deep link with a standard WalletConnect URI and is established when the counter-party approves this connection request. It also includes an optional Push server to allow Native applications to notify the user of incoming payloads for established connections.\n",
  "WallStreetBets": "A subreddit where participants discuss stock and option trading. The subreddit, describing itself through the tagline \"Like 4chan found a Bloomberg terminal,\" is known for its aggressive trading strategies, which primarily revolve around highly speculative, leveraged options trading. Members of the subreddit are often young retail traders and investors who ignore fundamental investment practices and risk management techniques, so their activities are often considered gambling. The growing popularity of no-commission brokers and mobile online trading has potentially contributed to the growth of such trading trends. Members of the communities often see high-risk day trading as an opportunity to quickly improve their financial conditions and obtain additional income. Some of the members tend to use borrowed capital, like student loans, to bet on certain \"meme stocks\" that show popularity within the community. The subreddit is also known for its profane and juvenile nature, with members often referring to themselves as \"autists\", \"retards\", \"degenerates\", and \"apes\". Users also frequently use slang such as \"stonks\" for stocks; \"tendies\" for gains or profits; \"gay bears\" for those who expect a stock to decline, for stock shorters, or as a general insult; \"DD\" for analysis of potential trades (from \"due diligence\"); \"bagholder\" for one whose position has severely dropped in value; \"diamond hands\" for holding stocks adamantly; and \"paper hands\" for selling at the first sign of loss.\n",
  "WanSwap": "An innovative crosschain automatic market making (AMM) decentralized exchange (DEX).\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs) have gained popularity in the last few years, with a major adoption being done in 2020 alone as DeFi exploded. However, WanSwap is not just another DEX. Using its proprietary Wanchain, the platform is able to provide functionalities that other DEXs fail to deliver.\n\nOne issue that modern DEXs face is that tokens being traded should be native to their chain. For example, UniSwap, one the most used ones, is based on Ethereum and therefore, only ERC-20 compliant tokens can be traded on it.\n\nWanSwap solves this issue by creating a wrapped token for each pair. A pioneer in this, WanSwap even lets traders swap for BTC using their native wanBTC, which maintains its value with the underlying original BTC. To assist people who want to convert the wrapped tokens back into the pegged original ones, users can head over to their Storeman Node based bridges.\n",

  "Wash Trade": "A form of market manipulation in which investors create artificial activity in the marketplace by simultaneously selling and buying the same cryptocurrencies.\n",
  "Wash Trading": "A process whereby a trader buys and sells a security for the express purpose of feeding misleading information to the market. In some situations, wash trades are executed by a trader and a broker who are colluding with each other, and other times wash trades are executed by investors acting as both the buyer and the seller of the security. Wash trading is illegal under U.S. law, and the IRS bars taxpayers from deducting losses that result from wash trades from their taxable income.\n\n Wash trading was first barred by the federal government after passage of the Commodity Exchange Act in 1936, a law that amended the Grain Futures Act and also required all commodity trading to occur on regulated exchanges. Prior to their proscription in the 1930s, wash trading was a popular way for stock manipulators to falsely signal interest in a stock in an attempt to pump up the value, so that these manipulators could make money shorting the stock. \n\nCommodity Futures Trade Commission (CFTC) regulations also prohibit brokers from profiting from wash trades, even if they claim they weren't aware of the traders intentions. Brokers therefore must perform due diligence on their customers to make sure that they are buying shares in a company for the purpose of common beneficial ownership.\n\nThe IRS also has strict regulations against wash trading, and requires that taxpayers refrain from deducting losses that result from wash sales. The IRS defines a wash sale as one that occurs within 30 days of the buying of the security, and results in a loss.\n",

  "Weak Subjectivity": "Weak subjectivity is a concept created by Vitalik Buterin to describe a requirement found on Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchains, where nodes need to rely on other nodes to determine what is the current state of the system.\n\nTo understand weak subjectivity, we first need to understand what objectivity and subjectivity mean in the context of blockchains. These concepts are related to the idea that a blockchain - as a distributed system - often presents more than one valid chain. In other words, there are multiple possible paths from the genesis block to the most recent block, and all of them can be considered valid.\n\nDepending on the way a blockchain is designed, nodes aren’t always able to quickly define which is the active chain (i.e., which path to choose). When it comes to Bitcoin, the system is designed in such a way that the participants of the network (nodes) are expected to choose the chain (path) that has the most accumulated work in it. This is related to the process of mining and is what gives objectivity to the Bitcoin network.\n\nSo, we may define objectivity as the ability for a new node to join the network and quickly “learn” which is the active chain (also referred to as the longest chain). Put in another way, objectivity means that new nodes can easily synchronize to the valid state of the system because there is only one path that can be considered the longest.\n\nOn the other hand, some networks may present a strong subjectivity, meaning that defining which chain is the active one is not as straightforward. In essence, subjectivity is related to a blockchain network that is open to multiple interpretations. Mainly because their consensus mechanism is conditioned by a “social network” that relies on the interaction between nodes.\n\nIn this case, the nodes need to help each other when reaching consensus instead of following a deterministic rule, such as the “longest chain rule.” And that’s what gives a certain degree of subjectivity to some blockchain networks.\n\nSo we may say that subjectivity is related to the idea that certain nodes need to receive information from other nodes when trying to determine the current state of the ledger. Note that this is not related to consensus achievement but rather to determining which chain is the active one.\n\nFinally, we have the concept of weak subjectivity, which was created by Vitalik Buterin as a requirement for blockchains that implement a PoS model. In short, new nodes (or nodes that are disconnected from the network for a long period) need weak subjectivity to learn which is the active chain.\n\nSo, if a node remains online continuously, there won’t be a subjectivity problem because they will be able to quickly determine which ledger is the “valid” one. But if the node goes offline for a long period of time, they will need to rely on other nodes, and that is where subjectivity happens. Still, the subjectivity is considered weak because it only occurs in two situations: when new nodes join the network, or when nodes go offline for long periods.\n",

  "WebSocket": "A computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.\n\nWebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket \"is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries,\" thus making it compatible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol enables interaction between a web browser (or other client application) and a web server with lower overhead than half-duplex alternatives such as HTTP polling, facilitating real-time data transfer from and to the server. This is made possible by providing a standardized way for the server to send content to the client without being first requested by the client, and allowing messages to be passed back and forth while keeping the connection open. In this way, a two-way ongoing conversation can take place between the client and the server. The communications are usually done over TCP port number 443 (or 80 in the case of unsecured connections), which is beneficial for environments that block non-web Internet connections using a firewall. Similar two-way browser-server communications have been achieved in non-standardized ways using stopgap technologies such as Comet.\n\nMost browsers support the protocol, including Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera.\n\nUnlike HTTP, WebSocket provides full-duplex communication. Additionally, WebSocket enables streams of messages on top of TCP. TCP alone deals with streams of bytes with no inherent concept of a message. Before WebSocket, port 80 full-duplex communication was attainable using Comet channels; however, Comet implementation is nontrivial, and due to the TCP handshake and HTTP header overhead, it is inefficient for small messages. The WebSocket protocol aims to solve these problems without compromising the security assumptions of the web.\n\nThe WebSocket protocol specification defines ws (WebSocket) and wss (WebSocket Secure) as two new uniform resource identifier (URI) schemes that are used for unencrypted and encrypted connections, respectively. Apart from the scheme name and fragment (i.e. # is not supported), the rest of the URI components are defined to use URI generic syntax.\n\nUsing browser developer tools, developers can inspect the WebSocket handshake as well as the WebSocket frames.\n",

  "Whiteheart": "An on-chain hedging protocol built on top of the Hegic protocol. The core part of the hedging protocol is a new financial primitive called hedge contract. Hedge contract is a system of Ethereum smart contracts that can automatically conduct the process of hedging users' holdings' market value. The way a hedge contract works is it can automatically buy an at-the-money (ATM) put option contract on the user's behalf each time the user acquires an asset on a decentralized exchange (DEX). A put option is a right but not an obligation to sell an asset at a fixed price during a certain period of time. Hedging with at-the-money (ATM) put options means that the strike price of an option at the moment of protecting an asset's value will be equal to the market price of the asset with a potential <1% spread. Hedge contracts utilize liquidity which is pooled by liquidity providers on non-custodial smart contracts. Liquidity providers act as the value downside insurance sellers who are pooling their funds on smart contracts for sharing the potential fees on selling this type of insurance represented as ATM put options. Liquidity providers earn fees paid by hedge contracts users in case the value of assets will not decrease.\n\n",

  "Wick": "A line found on a candlestick chart which is used to indicate where the price of an asset is fluctuating in regards to its opening and closing prices. Wicks may also be referred to as whiskers, shadows or tails.\n\nIn terms of financial markets, a wick is simply a vertical line that helps you visualize the high and low ranges of price action. This means that when reading a typical candlestick chart, traders will focus, among other things, on three key points — the opening price, the closing price, and the candlestick wicks.\n\nThe wicks themselves show extremes in prices, allowing traders to better understand market sentiment and momentum. This means that as the price moves in relation to the opening and closing price, wicks are formed as a visual record of such movement.\n\nThe candlestick pattern is created based on the open, high, low, and close of a market. The “box” portion of the candlestick is known as the body, whereas the lines on either end are the wicks (representing associated highs and lows). \n\nThe length of the wick is also relevant. For example, when there is a long wick at the bottom of the candle, it indicates that the price went all the way down and back up again before the close of the candle. This suggests an increase in buying right after a period of selling pressure. This is why some technical analysts believe that a long wick will often indicate price reversal, moving the market in the opposite direction of that wick.\n\nAlternatively, there is also the possibility of a wickless candle. These candles look like a square or rectangle because the closing and opening prices coincide with the high and low marks of that particular candlestick.\n",

WISE incorporates some of the features from both of these traditional instruments but improves greatly upon them.\n\nCDs tend to be lower risk, lower return, and only pay out interest on their maturity date.\n\nBonds tend to be somewhat higher risk, higher return, and pay out interest regularly on a set schedule (typically every six months).\n\nWISE is most similar to a bond, in that it earns relatively high interest, but allows users to withdraw it whenever they want.\n\nWISE is superior to bonds and CDs in every way:\n\nWISE gives the staker complete flexibility in choosing exactly when to withdraw their interest during the life of the stake. Users can withdraw interest daily, irregularly, wait until maturity, or whatever you like!\n\nWISE stakes have higher return, much lower risk (due to being decentralized and trustless), and far higher flexibility than both bonds and CDs.

  "Wrapped Bomb Token": "Users wanted BOMB Token on Uniswap. Unfortunately, Uniswap does not support the burning properties of the BOMB Token. We cherish the deflationary aspect of BOMB so much and we couldn't compromise that, however we were able to come up with a way BOMB can be on uniswap without creating an entirely new token. We made WBOMB (Wrapped BOMB). WBOMB is essentially a wrapped BOMB. This version still maintains the integrity of Bomb by burning 1% and maintaining zero decimals. The only difference is that it doesn't burn when being sent to Uniswap. This is achieved by use of a whitelist that allows us to specify non-burn addresses. In the future we will also be able to whitelist other smart contracts, if and when we need that feature. In the future, it's planned to produce a series of governance dapps that will ultimately control this whitelist, and hopefully other aspects of the project and community fund via community voting.\n",

The contract is responsible for ensuring that only authorized user or contract accounts may write to sensitive storage locations. If an attacker is able to write to arbitrary storage locations of a contract, the authorization checks may easily be circumvented. This can allow an attacker to corrupt the storage; for instance, by overwriting a field that stores the address of the contract owner.

XIOTRI has formulated a unique algorithm that rewards its participants in liquidity mining through the contribution of assets to the ecosystem, but disincentives being overly greedy. Inflation is reduced over a 3 year period to continually provide value to help sustain token value. The algorithm allows more users to participate in the staking process and receive rewards rather than the spoils being garnished by a few causing the ecosystem to lose its balance.

A shielded transaction uses a type of zero-knowledge proof called zk-SNARKs, which provides anonymity to the coin holders in the transaction. Zcash coins are either in a transparent pool or a shielded pool. As of December 2017, only around 4% of Zcash coins were in the shielded pool and at that time most cryptocurrency wallet programs did not support z-addrs and no web-based wallets supported them. The shielded pool of Zcash coins were further analyzed for security and it was found that the anonymity set can be shrunk considerably by heuristics-based identifiable patterns of usage.\n\nZcash affords private transactors the option of \"selective disclosure\", allowing a user to prove payment for auditing purposes. One such reason is to allow private transactors the choice to comply with anti-money laundering or tax regulations. \"Transactions are auditable but disclosure is under the participant's control.\" The company has hosted virtual meetings with law enforcement agencies around the U.S. to explain these fundamentals and has gone on the record of saying that \"they did not develop the currency to facilitate illegal activity\".\n",

Since its being exercised is almost certain, this option replicates a long position taken in the underlying asset without any right in its proceeds (dividends or interest payments) up to expiration date. This type of option is typically instrumental to overcome restrictions imposed by governments in terms of the transfer of securities (transfer tax, ownership restriction, etc).\n",
  "Zero Knowledge Decentralized Finance": "Regulators can verify that a lending platform or contract is sufficiently collateralized, without revealing the details and personal information of the contract. Or users can also sell their financial data to AI applications for zkAnalytics.\n",
  "Zero Knowledge Podcast": "A podcast which goes deep into the tech that will power the emerging [Web3](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recVaQXrnlGvOBGxU) and the community that is building it. The podcast is made for fellow developers and people looking to educate themselves on the inner workings of the space. Zero Knowledge is hosted by Anna Rose and Fredrik Harrysson, two people working in the [blockchain](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recooNBHGTw3CDbtG) industry.\n",
  "Zero Knowledge Proof": "A method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that they know a value x, without conveying any information apart from the fact that they know the value x. The essence of zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove that one possesses knowledge of certain information by simply revealing it; the challenge is to prove such possession without revealing the information itself or any additional information.\n",
  "Zero Trust Assets ": "[Trustless issuance](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recY91zpPTd0i9lgh) & [Trustless settlement](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/rec0xj5tzXs8gCCO2)\n",
  "Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge": "The acronym zk-SNARK stands for “Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge,” and refers to a proof construction where one can prove possession of certain information, e.g. a secret key, without revealing that information, and without any interaction between the prover and verifier.\n",
  "ZeroPool": "A fully private multi-blokchain solution. Low transaction fees, atomic swaps and common anonymity set. Balances and transaction graph are hidden and compatibility with network identity hiding technologies, like Tor. Users can deposit, transfer and withdraw tokens in their product.\n\nThe project was found at ethDenver by a group of reserchers and still developed as product with strong scientific base.\n",
  "Zeroswap": "A multi-chain compatible decentralised exchange aggregator protocol focused on making zero-fee transactions possible. They are aiming to make on-chain trading simple and easy, by providing access to multi-chains like Ethereum, BSC, Polkadot and Elrond under one roof. The core product is being designed to function gasless and focused on aggregating liquidity from multiple protocols. They will use meta transactions for gasless transactions. Initially, they will bootstrap the gas. At a later stage, they will be using transaction fee mining and the relayer will get ZEE tokens for gasless transactions.\n",
  "Zesty Market": "A monetization platform for Internet communities, owned by Internet communities. Their goal is to provide creators with a method of capturing the value that they create without dependence on a centralized platform.\n\nTheir first product is an alternative to centralized advertising networks that have come to extract an outsized amount of value from creators. Twitch takes 50% of all revenue from subscriptions, and YouTube only shares 30-40% of the ad revenue with its video creators. Sometimes, these platforms have been known to outright demonetize the creator, where the person is no longer able to earn an income from the content that they create. They think that these platforms have too much power over the livelihoods of people.\n\nAt their current iteration of the product, Zesty enables tokenization of digital ad spaces, whether it's in VR or a section of a livestream into an NFT. The NFT can be rented out to an advertiser. The revenue from the rental would go directly to the creator on-chain. Zesty Market will generate revenues from fees. They plan to offer the product first for the WebXR market, but will be expanding to other platforms.\n\nZesty will exit to the community, which means that one day they will be owned by their most loyal users, which will include creators and advertisers. So instead of having to purchase shares of Google (who owns YouTube) or Amazon (who owns Twitch), people will be able to grow their ownership share in Zesty just by using it. With a financial and attention ecosystem that would be favorable for creators, Zesty Market will pave the way for the future metaverse (whatever this might be), where everyone has a stake.\n",
  "ZestyToken": "Native token of Zesty Market. ZestyTokens adopts the Governor Alpha version of Compound's COMP token specification, Compound's implementation was chosen as it was simple and reliable. The protocol may adopt the Governor Bravo specification by Compound at a later date. Zesty Market is grateful for the contributions of Compound in the Ethereum ecosystem.\n\nLikewise with Compound protocol, Zesty Market will be governed and upgraded by ZESTY token holders. The components are; ZestyToken, GovernorAlpha, and Timelock. Proposals are much more general on Zesty Market as compared to Compound. The Timelock contract can be treated as the decentralized owner of ZestyMarket.\n\nZestyTokens has a fixed supply of 100,000,000 ZESTY. Any address with more than 1,000,000 ZESTY (1% of ZESTY) delegated to it may propose governance actions, which are executable code. When a proposal is created, the community can submit their votes during a 3 day voting period. If a majority, and at least 7,000,000 (7% of ZESTY) votes are cast for the proposal, it is queued in the Timelock, and can be implemented after a minimum of 2 days.\n\nZestyToken is an ERC-20 token that allows the owner to delegate voting rights to any address, including their own address. Changes to the owner’s token balance automatically adjust the voting rights of the delegate.\n",
  "zHEGIC Token": "This token allows the zLOT protocol to track the share and performance of the staking lots within zLOT’s pool. When the pool is launched, the zHEGIC exchange rate begins at 1 zHEGIC = 1 HEGIC and the exchange rate increases equal to the protocol performance.\n",
  "Zima Red": "Newsletter by Andrew Steinwold, covering NFTs, Virtual Worlds, and Blockchain Games.\n",
  "ZK Rollups": "One of the options being developed for layer 2 construction that increases scalability through mass transfer processing rolled into a single transaction. Where Plasma creates one transaction per transfer, ZK-Rollups bundle hundreds of transfers into a single transaction. The smart contract will deconstruct and verify all of the transfers held in a single transaction.\n\nA \"zero knowledge proof\" approach is used to present and publicly record the validity of the block on the Ethereum blockchain. ZK reduces computing and storage resources for validating the block by reducing the amount of data held in a transaction; zero knowledge of the entire data is needed.\n\nThe ZK-Rollup scheme consists of two types of users: transactors and relayers. Transactors create their transfer and broadcast the transfer to the network. The transfer data consists of an indexed \"to\" and \"from\" address, a value to transact, the network fee, and nonce. A shortened 3 byte indexed version of the addresses reduces processing resource needs. The value of the transaction being greater than or less than zero creates a deposit or withdrawal respectively. The smart contract records the data in two Merkle Trees; addresses in one Merkle Tree and transfer amounts in another.\n\nRelayers collect a large amount of transfers to create a rollup. It is the relayers job to generate the SNARK proof. The SNARK proof is a hash that represents the delta of the blockchain state. State refers to \"state of being.\" SNARK proof compares a snapshot of the blockchain before the transfers to a snapshot of the blockchain after the transfers (i.e. wallet values) and reports only the changes in a verifiable hash to the mainnet.\n\nIt is worth noting that anyone can become a relayer so long as they have staked the required bond in the smart contract. This incentivises the relayer not to tamper with or withhold a rollup.\n",
  "zk-Assets": "zkERC-20 tokens, zkAssets include zkUSD, zkBTC, zkETH and virtually any other asset to which users want to peg value. They are the private, stable-valued side of the [Offshift](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recMOHH24PLqZ56jL) ecosystem, and can only be minted by burning [XFT](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/rec5XaYKwkHyDSJLp). zkAssets are the first cryptographically private [stablecoins ](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recgjE63E13gmQDXL)on [Ethereum](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/recHnQzGJpRxx1FFd).\n",

Abstracts away the complexities of [Aztec Protocol](https://airtable.com/tblFrdJTpCGVizbA4/viwwkFxyYjeXPlkHP/rec4XQR6n1D9sGoTA)'s cryptography, so developers can integrate privacy simply.\n",
  "zkMesh": "A monthly newsletter about the latest in decentralised privacy-preserving technologies, privacy protocol development and zero knowledge systems research. zkMesh is put together by Mikerah (HashCloak) and Anna (Zero Knowledge Podcast, zkSummit).\n",
  "zkSync": "A scaling and privacy engine for Ethereum. Its current functionality scope includes low gas transfers of ETH and ERC20 tokens in the Ethereum network. zkSync is built on ZK Rollup architecture. ZK Rollup is an L2 scaling solution in which all funds are held by a smart contract on the mainchain, while computation and storage are performed off-chain. For every Rollup block, a state transition zero-knowledge proof (SNARK) is generated and verified by the mainchain contract. This SNARK includes the proof of the validity of every single transaction in the Rollup block. Additionally, the public data update for every block is published over the mainchain network in the cheap calldata.\n",
  "zLOT Finance": "The first staking protocol built upon Hegic. Staking Lots are the only participants that are able to earn 100% of settlement fees in ETH and WBTC generated by the Hegic’s protocol. However, there are currently only 27 addresses eligible to buy at least a staking lot. ZLOT Finance looks forward to further democratize the access to the staking lots by pooling $HEGIC tokens within smaller holders in order for everyone to benefit from the settlement fees generated by the Hegic’s protocol. Users can deposit $HEGIC on the HegicPool.sol contract in order to acquire zHEGIC, the tokenized share of the pool.\n",
  "ZLOT Token": "The governance token for the zLOT protocol, token holders will have the right to: (1) vote on changes for the protocol; (2) receive 10% of the profits from the protocol (performance fee); and (3) receive 0.3% of the withdrawal fees from the protocol.\n",
  "Zora": "A marketplace to buy, sell and trade limited-edition goods. All of these goods are launched as tokens. By dropping it as a token, they enable goods to be dynamically priced, fractionally traded, and launched before the item even exists. This  enables creator value-capture, community participation, creator-owned secondary markets, and \"Internet-owned\" brands.\n",
  "ZRX Token": "Native token of 0x. It has two main use cases within the protocol. The first is for paying trading fees to Relayers for their services. The second and most important use is to enable ZRX token owners to influence the protocol's governance. This means that the owners have authority, proportional to their holdings, to provide input as to how the protocol should be developed over time.\n",
  "ZXC Token": "Utility tokens used to pay for behind-the-scenes operations in dapps built using the 0xcert framework. You can think of ZXC as both a unit of value for 0xcert services and a bridge between blockchain and real-world use cases. ZXC tokens can be converted into dapp tokens.\n"
