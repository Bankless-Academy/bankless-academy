# Old Problems, New Tools

Modern technology has drastically changed the way in which humans view and interact with each other. On the world stage, and in a borderless cyberspace, we need new coordination models in order to coexist and thrive as a global tribe.

The vision of `DAO` technology is to greatly streamline problem solving and debate between multiple parties ‚Äî whether on the internet, in your local community, or on an international scale. This is done by:

- Incentivizing participants to share a common mission.
- Innovative vote, delegate, and veto mechanics.
- Using blockchain technology to increase the difficulty of human error or attack.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/old-problems-new-tools-1caefce6.svg)

# The Optimism Network

`DAOs` like the `Optimism Network` are at the frontier of exploring such coordination systems.

In this lesson, we will explore how Optimism (OP) is pioneering the DAO vision. We will learn about their mission, and how they‚Äôre building new frameworks for human coordination in order to achieve it.

Our quest will focus on claiming our first voting rights, so we‚Äôre ready to help build the future of Ethereum, and human coordination!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/the-optimism-network-d43cccdf.svg)

# Network **Governance**

Like any real world nation-state with resources and participants, a `DAO` hosts a governance process to steer the deployment of its resources and achievement of its mission. This process is called `onchain governance`: a series of online proposals, community discussions, and votes. It‚Äôs like a townhall, but `asynchronous`, global, and mediated by code.

On Ethereum, onchain governance can serve a variety of functions, like choosing network upgrades, responding to economic challenges, protecting the network from attack, or improving the governance process itself! Onchain governance allows a network to evolve while staying true to its shared mission.

With many blockchain networks still in their early days, todays voices are extremely high impact in deciding the future of online communities tomorrow.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/network-governance-ec1d1abb.svg)

# Knowledge Check 1

How can onchain governance help to solve interhuman debate?

- [ ] By automating human coordination, and evolving based on shared human feedback.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] Through transparent, attack-resistant voting processes.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] By hosting an opt-in, mission-oriented community for people across the world.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Correct! Onchain governance aims to streamline and protect discussion.

# **The Optimistic Mission**

Optimism is on a mission to scale Ethereum by building a `Layer 2` network ‚Äî a place with lower fees, faster transactions, and Ethereum‚Äôs high standard of security. Here‚Äôs what it looks like:

‚öíÔ∏è **Free Market:** The OP Network was launched as an extension of not just Ethereum `blockspace`, but of Ethereum principles. It aims to scale the permissionless, open-source, censorship-resistant marketplace of Ethereum.

üèïÔ∏è **Public Goods:** OP puts great emphasis on funding and building onchain `public goods`. These are free-to-access, infinite resources & facilities available to all network citizens. Your free education at Bankless Academy has been made possible through Optimism‚Äôs public goods grants ecosystem!

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **Community Governance:** Governance is commanded by the community, structured for iterative growth. OP uses a seasonal governance format, giving opportunity for the community to digest, reflect on, and discuss the previous events and iterations of governance.

The ecosystem is a capitalist district of cyberspace that directly provides for, and is governed by, its citizens!

# Knowledge Check 2

What definition best fits a ‚Äòpublic good‚Äô?

- [ ] An unlimited good shared amongst a specific group of people.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try again! This defines a private, infinite good, like a cinema or toll road.

- [ ] A public resource that cannot run out.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Correct! This defines a public, infinite good, like software or knowledge.

- [ ] Free, limited access to a public service.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try again! This defines a public, finite service, like socialized healthcare.

# Progressive Decentralization

Many great blockchain projects begin with a centralized group and vision. This gives the project crucial focus in building and spending, but a global community needs more than promises of eventual decentralization to truly be a DAO.

On OP, the founder and community groups are thought of as follows:

- üè¶ **Optimism Foundation:** The network founders, steward of the Collective. They run governance experiments, provide initial resources, build partnerships, and start the ecosystem.
- üë¨ **Optimism Collective:** The governing community; a diverse set of global participants. They are responsible for the long term ownership and management of the ecosystem.

There are legal checks and balances, such as the Collective‚Äôs ability to remove members of the Foundation. This ensures slow transfer of network ownership to the community, before the Foundation eventually dissolves.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/progressive-decentralization-d2955246.svg)

# Knowledge Check 3

True or false?

The Optimism Foundation will continue to guide the Optimism Collective over the network‚Äôs lifetime.

- [ ] True

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try again!

- [ ] False

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Correct! The Foundation will eventually dissolve, and the Collective will continue the mission.

# A New **Economy**

At the center of the Optimism `L2` economy is the Optimistic flywheel. This economic cycle generates revenue, network growth, and the achievement of the Optimistic mission.

1. Users and `dApps` demand network `blockspace`.
2. The network generates revenue via transaction fees.
3. A portion of these taxes are distributed to builders providing impactful public goods infrastructure.
4. Everyone gains access to free resources & services.

With more valuable onchain infrastructure, demand for OP blockspace increases, and the cycle continues!

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/a-new-economy-2981ffe5.png)

# **Incentivizing** **the Public Goods Economy**

As you can see, Public Goods infrastructure is at the heart of Optimism. Yet selecting projects worth funding isn‚Äôt simple.

Here, OP takes an ‚Äò**Impact = Profit**‚Äô approach. Impact, however, is difficult to anticipate. Rather than making predictions, the funding body periodically looks over existing projects and assigns retroactive funding based on historic performance.

As Vitalik Buterin said, _‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to agree on what¬†was¬†useful than what¬†will be¬†useful.‚Äù_

This distribution model is known as ‚ÄòRetroactive Public Goods Funding‚Äô, or ‚ÄòRetroPGF‚Äô. This funding mechanism incentivises optimistic thinkers to build public goods that are of service to humanity. It liberates us from the value-extraction mindset of traditional free markets. OP calls this effect ‚Äò**Ether‚Äôs Phoenix‚Äô**: an ‚Äúangel reaching backwards in time, rewarding those who summon it.‚Äù

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/incentivizing-the-public-goods-economy-adc49d00.svg)

# **Incentivizing the Public Goods Economy**

_‚ÄúIt is an algorithm that rewards the early cooperators who created conditions for public goods funding to prosper. It is a future where early investment in public goods is recognized. It is also a mindset: that optimism prevails, that better systems are possible, and that humankind will be rewarded for its cooperative revolution.‚Äù_

‚Äî The Optimism Foundation

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/incentivizing-the-public-goods-economy-3bf9db24.svg)

# Knowledge Check 4

How is Optimism incentivizing community-focused economics?

- [ ] By rewarding all Optimism projects with retroactive funding.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try again! Rewarding all projects regardless of their mission

- [ ] By providing a free market, but on the blockchain.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try again! Use of blockchain technology alone doesn‚Äôt effect economic models.

- [ ] By systemically funding business models that improve the lives of all network users.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Correct! The network allocates a portion of transaction fees towards funding public goods.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Try again! Only one of these is true.

# Introducing the Governing Houses

There are two houses in OP governance, with independent and shared responsibilities in running the network.

**The Token House** is responsible for managing network upgrades, incentives, and treasury. Its stakeholder structure incentivizes growth of the network economy, and generates stakeholder value. The house is also responsible for preserving decentralization ‚Äî preventing capture of the network economy.

**The Citizens‚Äô House** allocates `RetroPGF` resources to community projects, according to the ‚ÄòImpact = Profit‚Äô ethos, and helps decide the parameters of citizenship. The house is incentivized to improve network quality-of-life, by funding public goods that improve the value of citizenship!

Both houses maintain network balance through their duties, voting mechanics, and `veto` abilities. You can join either house, or both! Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/introducing-the-governing-houses-992f67be.png)

# Knowledge Check 5

How does the Citizens‚Äô House differ from the Token House?

- [ ] The Citizens‚Äô House is the only house with veto abilities.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Try again! Both houses have veto powers.

- [ ] The Citizens‚Äô House allocates RetroPGF rewards.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Correct! The Citizens‚Äô House allocates public goods funding.

- [ ] The Citizens‚Äô House leads network decentralization.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Try again! Both houses maintain decentralization.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Try again!

# The Token House

The Token House maintains the economy and defenses of the OP Network.

Duties include:

- ‚öíÔ∏è Review and approval of **upgrades to network mechanics**.
- ‚õìÔ∏è Selection of network `block producers`.
- üìà **Allocation of revenue,** using collected transaction fees to fuel network growth.

The Citizens‚Äô House has the right to veto any proposal under the above categories.

The Token house also has the ability to veto any proposal submitted by the Citizens‚Äô House, or the Optimism Foundation, seen to be **reducing rights** of tokenholders.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/the-token-house-6d73a8ae.svg)

# Token House: Joining, Voting, Delegating

Joining the Token House is done via purchasing and holding OP tokens. Voting power scales based on how many tokens are held. These are `ERC20` tokens, and are therefore transferrable; They can be bought and sold on `CEXs`, Optimism `DEXs`, or sent between friends. OP tokens are not available on other networks.

Now, network governance is only as democratic as its initial `token distribution` ‚Äî meaning who received voting power in the first place. Check out the [OP distribution plan](https://community.optimism.io/docs/governance/allocations/#allocations-at-a-glance) to see how the Optimism Foundation has allocated initial governance power, in service of balanced community representation.

Many users prefer to delegate their voting power to leading community members that they feel best represent the community‚Äôs interests. This is a great way to have an impact on the ecosystem without having to read every proposal that enters voting. Delegation allows you to maintain ownership of your tokens!

Anyone can become a Token House delegate on Optimism, representing a group of friends, a community, or even a university‚Äôs blockchain club! Large, active delegates are often rewarded by the community.

# Knowledge Check 6

How does the Token House protect the network from attack?

- [ ] By selecting a diverse set of network block producers.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] By vetoing Optimism Foundation proposals seen to be reducing token holder rights.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] By carefully reviewing network upgrade proposals.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] All of the above.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Correct! The Token House has a diverse set of responsibilities in protecting the network.

# The Citizens‚Äô House

The Citizens‚Äô House conducts the growth of public infrastructure on the Optimism Network.

Duties include:

- üéØ **Defining RetroPGF metrics and impact** criteria for measuring project performance.
- üîç **Research and allocation of RetroPGF** to community projects meeting the set guidelines.
- üë¨ **Selection of new citizens** to help govern the Citizens‚Äô House, and balance Token House perspective. The Token House has veto rights for this type of proposal.

![](https://app.banklessacademy.com/lesson/images/optimism-governance/the-citizens-house-fd4eef9e.svg)

# Citizens‚Äô House: Joining, Voting, Delegating

New joiners to the Citizens‚Äô House are currently onboarded by invitation, to slowly scale and refine House process. Membership is marked by holding a ‚ÄòCitizen Badge‚Äô ‚Äî a nontransferable `ERC-721` token.

Invitation can happen in a number of ways, but the specifics change season to season:

- Current citizens may be granted an additional invite, to be shared with someone they see as a great addition to the network.
- Previous RetroPGF recipients have been granted the opportunity to select one community member for citizen status.
- The Optimism Foundation has issued citizenship to project builders using the network.

Each citizen has a single vote. Their voting power is non-transferrable, and cannot be delegated. This prevents gathering of House power under a small number of citizens.

# Knowledge Check 7

How does the Citizens‚Äô House protect the network from attack?

- [ ] By expanding the number of Citizens‚Äô House members.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] By vetoing Token House proposals seen to be leading to power imbalance.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è This is true, but it isn‚Äôt the only answer.

- [ ] Both of the above.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è  Correct! This house diversifies its own perspective, and balances Token House perspective.

# Now‚Ä¶ Think Even Bigger!

We‚Äôre almost ready to govern on üî¥Optimism. There‚Äôs one last thing to mention.

The OP vision doesn‚Äôt stop at a single `L2` blockchain. As result of the ability to `fork` a blockchain, this is a cloneable governance experiment. OP technology is built to be scaled across multiple L2s ‚Äî and even into real world governance scenarios. OP calls this **the Superchain**.

Coinbase haw already forked and started contributing to this `open source` initiative, through the üîµBase blockchain. This collaborative pooling of development resources increases infrastructure evolution, while funneling L2 transaction fees towards OP‚Äôs ‚ÄòImpact = Profit‚Äô ethos.

Superchain networks who abide by the OP governance process receive numerous benefits. This incentive model sets a bright vision for future internet economies, if we can build sustainable, community-oriented governance practices on Optimism today!

# Shaping an Optimistic Future

History has always been paved by the optimists of humanity ‚Äî those that dared to think big, and act to achieve it.

By getting involved in innovative communities, using truly `trustless` & fair governance systems, we‚Äôre continuing a movement started at the dawn of humankind. Our diverse world deserves communication and coordination mechanisms that allow us to grow together. In learning to navigate our differences, humanity can thrive at local, global, and online scales.

We can start our OP Governance journey today by joining the Token House and delegating our tokens. While the Citizens‚Äô House develops its onboarding procedures, we can begin our Citizen journey by getting involved in the [OP community](https://gov.optimism.io/) forum ‚Äî offering our unique contribution to the OP vision!
